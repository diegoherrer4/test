It seems that about 50,000 years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals and
Denisovans were at that borderline point. They were almost, but not
quite, entirely separate species. As we shall see in the next chapter,
Sapiens were already very different from Neanderthals and Denisovans
not only in their genetic code and physical traits, but also in their
cognitive and social abilities, yet it appears it was still just possible, on
rare occasions, for a Sapiens and a Neanderthal to produce a fertile
offspring. So the populations did not merge, but a few lucky Neanderthal
genes did hitch a ride on the Sapiens Express. It is unsettling – and
perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex
with an animal from a different species, and produce children together.
3. A speculative reconstruction of a Neanderthal child. Genetic evidence hints that at least
some Neanderthals may have had fair skin and hair.
But if the Neanderthals, Denisovans and other human species didn’t
merge with Sapiens, why did they vanish? One possibility is that Homo
sapiens drove them to extinction. Imagine a Sapiens band reaching a
Balkan valley where Neanderthals had lived for hundreds of thousands
of years. The newcomers began to hunt the deer and gather the nuts and
berries that were the Neanderthals’ traditional staples. Sapiens were
more proficient hunters and gatherers – thanks to better technology and
superior social skills – so they multiplied and spread. The less
resourceful Neanderthals found it increasingly difficult to feed
themselves. Their population dwindled and they slowly died out, except
perhaps for one or two members who joined their Sapiens neighbours.
Another possibility is that competition for resources flared up into
violence and genocide. Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern
times, a small difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been
enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating
another group. Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards
an entirely different human species? It may well be that when Sapiens
encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant
ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.
Whichever way it happened, the Neanderthals (and the other human
species) pose one of history’s great what ifs. Imagine how things might
have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans survived alongside
Homo sapiens. What kind of cultures, societies and political structures
would have emerged in a world where several different human species
coexisted? How, for example, would religious faiths have unfolded?
Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend
from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the
Denisovans, and would the Qur’an have reserved seats in heaven for all
righteous humans, whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have
been able to serve in the Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy
of imperial China? Would the American Declaration of Independence
hold as a self-evident truth that all members of the genus Homo are
created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged workers of all species to
unite?
Over the past 10,000 years, Homo sapiens has grown so accustomed to
being the only human species that it’s hard for us to conceive of any
other possibility. Our lack of brothers and sisters makes it easier to
imagine that we are the epitome of creation, and that a chasm separates
us from the rest of the animal kingdom. When Charles Darwin indicated
that Homo sapiens was just another kind of animal, people were
outraged. Even today many refuse to believe it. Had the Neanderthals
survived, would we still imagine ourselves to be a creature apart?
Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals.
They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate.
Whether Sapiens are to blame or not, no sooner had they arrived at a
new location than the native population became extinct. The last
remains of Homo soloensis are dated to about 50,000 years ago. Homo
denisova disappeared shortly thereafter. Neanderthals made their exit
roughly 30,000 years ago. The last dwarf-like humans vanished from
Flores Island about 12,000 years ago. They left behind some bones, stone
tools, a few genes in our DNA and a lot of unanswered questions. They
also left behind us, Homo sapiens, the last human species.
What was the Sapiens’ secret of success? How did we manage to settle
so rapidly in so many distant and ecologically different habitats? How
did we push all other human species into oblivion? Why couldn’t even
the strong, brainy, cold-proof Neanderthals survive our onslaught? The
debate continues to rage. The most likely answer is the very thing that
makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks
above all to its unique language.
2
The Tree of Knowledge
IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER WE SAW THAT although Sapiens had
already populated East Africa 150,000 years ago, they began to overrun
the rest of planet Earth and drive the other human species to extinction
only about 70,000 years ago. In the intervening millennia, even though
these archaic Sapiens looked just like us and their brains were as big as
ours, they did not enjoy any marked advantage over other human
species, did not produce particularly sophisticated tools, and did not
accomplish any other special feats.
In fact, in the first recorded encounter between Sapiens and
Neanderthals, the Neanderthals won. About 100,000 years ago, some
Sapiens groups migrated north to the Levant, which was Neanderthal
territory, but failed to secure a firm footing. It might have been due to
nasty natives, an inclement climate, or unfamiliar local parasites.
Whatever the reason, the Sapiens eventually retreated, leaving the
Neanderthals as masters of the Middle East.
This poor record of achievement has led scholars to speculate that the
internal structure of the brains of these Sapiens was probably different
from ours. They looked like us, but their cognitive abilities – learning,
remembering, communicating – were far more limited. Teaching such an
ancient Sapiens English, persuading him of the truth of Christian dogma,
or getting him to understand the theory of evolution would probably
have been hopeless undertakings. Conversely, we would have had a very
hard time learning his language and understanding his way of thinking.
But then, beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started
doing very special things. Around that date Sapiens bands left Africa for
a second time. This time they drove the Neanderthals and all other
human species not only from the Middle East, but from the face of the
earth. Within a remarkably short period, Sapiens reached Europe and
East Asia. About 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea
and landed in Australia – a continent hitherto untouched by humans.
The period from about 70,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago
witnessed the invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and
needles (essential for sewing warm clothing). The first objects that can
reliably be called art date from this era (see the Stadel lion-man on this
page), as does the first clear evidence for religion, commerce and social
stratification.
Most researchers believe that these unprecedented accomplishments
were the product of a revolution in Sapiens’ cognitive abilities. They
maintain that the people who drove the Neanderthals to extinction,
settled Australia, and carved the Stadel lion-man were as intelligent,
creative and sensitive as we are. If we were to come across the artists of
the Stadel Cave, we could learn their language and they ours. We’d be
able to explain to them everything we know – from the adventures of
Alice in Wonderland to the paradoxes of quantum physics – and they
could teach us how their people view the world.
The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between
70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What
caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues
that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains
of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to
communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it
the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather
than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as
we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of
the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes. What was so special
about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world?
*
It was not the first language. Every animal has some kind of language.
Even insects, such as bees and ants, know how to communicate in
sophisticated ways, informing one another of the whereabouts of food.
Neither was it the first vocal language. Many animals, including all ape
and monkey species, have vocal languages. For example, green monkeys
use calls of various kinds to communicate. Zoologists have identified one
call that means, ‘Careful! An eagle!’ A slightly different call warns,
‘Careful! A lion!’ When researchers played a recording of the first call to
a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what they were doing and
looked upwards in fear. When the same group heard a recording of the
second call, the lion warning, they quickly scrambled up a tree. Sapiens
can produce many more distinct sounds than green monkeys, but whales
and elephants have equally impressive abilities. A parrot can say
anything Albert Einstein could say, as well as mimicking the sounds of
phones ringing, doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever advantage
Einstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so special
about our language?
The most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple.
We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an
infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can
thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of
information about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its
comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that
this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd
of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different
paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her
band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to
approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.
A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means
of sharing information about the world. But the most important
information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about
lions and bison. Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According
to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social
cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. It is not enough for
individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison.
It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates
whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.
4. An ivory figurine of a ‘lion-man’ (or ‘lioness-woman’) from the Stadel Cave in Germany
(c.32,000 years ago). The body is human, but the head is leonine. This is one of the first
indisputable examples of art, and probably of religion, and of the ability of the human
mind to imagine things that do not really exist.
The amount of information that one must obtain and store in order to
track the ever-changing relationships of a few dozen individuals is
staggering. (In a band of fifty individuals, there are 1,225 one-on-one
relationships, and countless more complex social combinations.) All apes
show a keen interest in such social information, but they have trouble
gossiping effectively. Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens probably
also had a hard time talking behind each other’s backs – a much
maligned ability which is in fact essential for cooperation in large
numbers. The new linguistic skills that modern Sapiens acquired about
seventy millennia ago enabled them to gossip for hours on end. Reliable
information about who could be trusted meant that small bands could
expand into larger bands, and Sapiens could develop tighter and more
sophisticated types of cooperation.1
The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies
support it. Even today the vast majority of human communication –
whether in the form of emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is
gossip. It comes so naturally to us that it seems as if our language
evolved for this very purpose. Do you think that history professors chat
about the reasons for World War One when they meet for lunch, or that
nuclear physicists spend their coffee breaks at scientific conferences
talking about quarks? Sometimes. But more often, they gossip about the
professor who caught her husband cheating, or the quarrel between the
head of the department and the dean, or the rumours that a colleague
used his research funds to buy a Lexus. Gossip usually focuses on
wrongdoings. Rumour-mongers are the original fourth estate, journalists
who inform society about and thus protect it from cheats and
freeloaders.
Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river
theory are valid. Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its
ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the
ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As
far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that
they have never seen, touched or smelled.
Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the
Cognitive Revolution. Many animals and human species could previously
say, ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens
acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe.’
This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens
language.
It’s relatively easy to agree that only Homo sapiens can speak about
things that don’t really exist, and believe six impossible things before
breakfast. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by
promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. But why
is it important? After all, fiction can be dangerously misleading or
distracting. People who go to the forest looking for fairies and unicorns
would seem to have less chance of survival than people who go looking
for mushrooms and deer. And if you spend hours praying to non-existing
guardian spirits, aren’t you wasting precious time, time better spent
foraging, fighting and fornicating?
But fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so
collectively. We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation
story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the
nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the
unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and
bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a very
rigid manner and only with close relatives. Wolves and chimpanzees
cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small
numbers of other individuals that they know intimately. Sapiens can
cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of
strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our
leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
The Legend of Peugeot
Our chimpanzee cousins usually live in small troops of several dozen
individuals. They form close friendships, hunt together and fight
shoulder to shoulder against baboons, cheetahs and enemy chimpanzees.
Their social structure tends to be hierarchical. The dominant member,
who is almost always a male, is termed the ‘alpha male’. Other males
and females exhibit their submission to the alpha male by bowing before
him while making grunting sounds, not unlike human subjects
kowtowing before a king. The alpha male strives to maintain social
harmony within his troop. When two individuals fight, he will intervene
and stop the violence. Less benevolently, he might monopolise
particularly coveted foods and prevent lower-ranking males from mating
with the females.
When two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so
by forming extensive coalitions of supporters, both male and female,
from within the group. Ties between coalition members are based on
intimate daily contact – hugging, touching, kissing, grooming and
mutual favours. Just as human politicians on election campaigns go
around shaking hands and kissing babies, so aspirants to the top position
in a chimpanzee group spend much time hugging, back-slapping and
kissing baby chimps. The alpha male usually wins his position not
because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable
coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt
struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities.
Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help
one another in times of trouble.
There are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and
maintained in such a way. In order to function, all members of a group
must know each other intimately. Two chimpanzees who have never
met, never fought, and never engaged in mutual grooming will not know
whether they can trust one another, whether it would be worthwhile to
help one another, and which of them ranks higher. Under natural
conditions, a typical chimpanzee troop consists of about twenty to fifty
individuals. As the number of chimpanzees in a troop increases, the
social order destabilises, eventually leading to a rupture and the
formation of a new troop by some of the animals. Only in a handful of
cases have zoologists observed groups larger than a hundred. Separate
groups seldom cooperate, and tend to compete for territory and food.
Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups, and
even one case of ‘genocidal’ activity in which one troop systematically
slaughtered most members of a neighbouring band.2
Similar patterns probably dominated the social lives of early humans,
including archaic Homo sapiens. Humans, like chimps, have social
instincts that enabled our ancestors to form friendships and hierarchies,
and to hunt or fight together. However, like the social instincts of
chimps, those of humans were adapted only for small intimate groups.
When the group grew too large, its social order destabilised and the
band split. Even if a particularly fertile valley could feed 500 archaic
Sapiens, there was no way that so many strangers could live together.
How could they agree who should be leader, who should hunt where, or
who should mate with whom?
In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens
to form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits.
Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a
group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can
neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150
human beings.
Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls
somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold,
communities, businesses, social networks and military units can
maintain themselves based mainly on intimate acquaintance and
rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law
books to keep order.3 A platoon of thirty soldiers or even a company of a
hundred soldiers can function well on the basis of intimate relations,
with a minimum of formal discipline. A well-respected sergeant can
become ‘king of the company and exercise authority even over
commissioned officers. A small family business can survive and flourish
without a board of directors, a CEO or an accounting department.
But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no
longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of
soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses
usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If
they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.
How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold,
eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants
and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the
appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate
successfully by believing in common myths.
Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a
medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in
common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination.
Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who
have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to
build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in
human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins.
States are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never
met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in
the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the
Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths. Two
lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend
a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws,
justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees.
Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent
and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no
money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common
imagination of human beings.
People easily understand that ‘primitives’ cement their social order by
believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance
together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our
modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Take for example
the world of business corporations. Modern business-people and lawyers
are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them
and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales. The
legend of Peugeot affords us a good example.
An icon that somewhat resembles the Stadel lion-man appears today on
cars, trucks and motorcycles from Paris to Sydney. It’s the hood
ornament that adorns vehicles made by Peugeot, one of the oldest and
largest of Europe’s carmakers. Peugeot began as a small family business
in the village of Valentigney, just 300 kilometres from the Stadel Cave.
Today the company employs about 200,000 people worldwide, most of
whom are complete strangers to each other. These strangers cooperate so
effectively that in 2008 Peugeot produced more than 1.5 million
automobiles, earning revenues of about 55 billion euros.
In what sense can we say that Peugeot SA (the company’s official
name) exists? There are many Peugeot vehicles, but these are obviously
not the company. Even if every Peugeot in the world were
simultaneously junked and sold for scrap metal, Peugeot SA would not
disappear. It would continue to manufacture new cars and issue its
annual report. The company owns factories, machinery and showrooms,
and employs mechanics, accountants and secretaries, but all these
together do not comprise Peugeot. A disaster might kill every single one
of Peugeot’s employees, and go on to destroy all of its assembly lines and
executive offices. Even then, the company could borrow money, hire
new employees, build new factories and buy new machinery. Peugeot
has managers and shareholders, but neither do they constitute the
company. All the managers could be dismissed and all its shares sold,
but the company itself would remain intact.
5. The Peugeot Lion
It doesn’t mean that Peugeot SA is invulnerable or immortal. If a judge
were to mandate the dissolution of the company, its factories would
remain standing and its workers, accountants, managers and
shareholders would continue to live – but Peugeot SA would
immediately vanish. In short, Peugeot SA seems to have no essential
connection to the physical world. Does it really exist?
Peugeot is a figment of our collective imagination. Lawyers call this a
‘legal fiction’. It can’t be pointed at; it is not a physical object. But it
exists as a legal entity. Just like you or me, it is bound by the laws of the
countries in which it operates. It can open a bank account and own
property. It pays taxes, and it can be sued and even prosecuted
separately from any of the people who own or work for it.
Peugeot belongs to a particular genre of legal fictions called ‘limited
liability companies’. The idea behind such companies is among
humanity’s most ingenious inventions. Homo sapiens lived for untold
millennia without them. During most of recorded history property could
be owned only by flesh-and-blood humans, the kind that stood on two
legs and had big brains. If in thirteenth-century France Jean set up a
wagon-manufacturing workshop, he himself was the business. If a wagon
he’d made broke down a week after purchase, the disgruntled buyer
would have sued Jean personally. If Jean had borrowed 1,000 gold coins
to set up his workshop and the business failed, he would have had to
repay the loan by selling his private property – his house, his cow, his
land. He might even have had to sell his children into servitude. If he
couldn’t cover the debt, he could be thrown in prison by the state or
enslaved by his creditors. He was fully liable, without limit, for all
obligations incurred by his workshop.
If you had lived back then, you would probably have thought twice
before you opened an enterprise of your own. And indeed this legal
situation discouraged entrepreneurship. People were afraid to start new
businesses and take economic risks. It hardly seemed worth taking the
chance that their families could end up utterly destitute.
This is why people began collectively to imagine the existence of
limited liability companies. Such companies were legally independent of
the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed
them. Over the last few centuries such companies have become the main
players in the economic arena, and we have grown so used to them that
we forget they exist only in our imagination. In the US, the technical
term for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic,
because the term derives from ‘corpus’ (‘body’ in Latin) – the one thing
these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the
American legal system treats corporations as legal persons, as if they
were flesh-and-blood human beings.
And so did the French legal system back in 1896, when Armand
Peugeot, who had inherited from his parents a metalworking shop that
produced springs, saws and bicycles, decided to go into the automobile
business. To that end, he set up a limited liability company. He named
the company after himself, but it was independent of him. If one of the
cars broke down, the buyer could sue Peugeot, but not Armand Peugeot.
If the company borrowed millions of francs and then went bust, Armand
Peugeot did not owe its creditors a single franc. The loan, after all, had
been given to Peugeot, the company, not to Armand Peugeot, the Homo
sapiens. Armand Peugeot died in 1915. Peugeot, the company, is still
alive and well.
How exactly did Armand Peugeot, the man, create Peugeot, the
company? In much the same way that priests and sorcerers have created
gods and demons throughout history, and in which thousands of French
curés were still creating Christ’s body every Sunday in the parish
churches. It all revolved around telling stories, and convincing people to
believe them. In the case of the French curés, the crucial story was that
of Christ’s life and death as told by the Catholic Church. According to
this story, if a Catholic priest dressed in his sacred garments solemnly
said the right words at the right moment, mundane bread and wine
turned into God’s flesh and blood. The priest exclaimed ‘Hoc est corpus
meum!’ (Latin for ‘This is my body!’) and hocus pocus – the bread turned
into Christ’s flesh. Seeing that the priest had properly and assiduously
observed all the procedures, millions of devout French Catholics behaved
as if God really existed in the consecrated bread and wine.
In the case of Peugeot SA the crucial story was the French legal code,
as written by the French parliament. According to the French legislators,
if a certified lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals, wrote all
the required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper,
and affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then
hocus pocus – a new company was incorporated. When in 1896 Armand
Peugeot wanted to create his company, he paid a lawyer to go through
all these sacred procedures. Once the lawyer had performed all the right
rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of
upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really
existed.
Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the
story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history
revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people
to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability
companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power,
because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards
common goals. Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to
create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about
things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.
Over the years, people have woven an incredibly complex network of
stories. Within this network, fictions such as Peugeot not only exist, but
also accumulate immense power. The kinds of things that people create
through this network of stories are known in academic circles as
‘fictions’, ‘social constructs’, or ‘imagined realities’. An imagined reality
is not a lie. I lie when I say that there is a lion near the river when I
know perfectly well that there is no lion there. There is nothing special
about lies. Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for
example, has been observed calling ‘Careful! A lion!’ when there was no
lion around. This alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey
who had just found a banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize
for itself.
Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes
in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality
exerts force in the world. The sculptor from the Stadel Cave may
sincerely have believed in the existence of the lion-man guardian spirit.
Some sorcerers are charlatans, but most sincerely believe in the
existence of gods and demons. Most millionaires sincerely believe in the
existence of money and limited liability companies. Most human-rights
activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights. No one was
lying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government
respect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and
human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations.
Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a
dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and
lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and
corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more
powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions
depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and
corporations.
