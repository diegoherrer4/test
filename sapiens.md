Building Pyramids

THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION IS ONE of the most controversial events in
history. Some partisans proclaim that it set humankind on the road to prosperity
and progress. Others insist that it led to perdition. This was the turning point, they
say, where Sapiens cast oʃ its intimate symbiosis with nature and sprinted
towards greed and alienation. Whichever direction the road led, there was no
going back. Farming enabled populations to increase so radically and rapidly that
no complex agricultural society could ever again sustain itself if it returned to
hunting and gathering. Around 10,000 BC, before the transition to agriculture,
earth was home to about 5–8 million nomadic foragers. By the ɹrst century AD,
only 1–2 million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America and Africa), but
their numbers were dwarfed by the world’s 250 million farmers.1
The vast majority of farmers lived in permanent settlements; only a few were
nomadic shepherds. Settling down caused most peoples turf to shrink
dramatically. Ancient hunter-gatherers usually lived in territories covering many
dozens and even hundreds of square kilometres. ‘Home’ was the entire territory,
with its hills, streams, woods and open sky. Peasants, on the other hand, spent
most of their days working a small ɹeld or orchard, and their domestic lives
centred on a cramped structure of wood, stone or mud, measuring no more than a
few dozen metres – the house. The typical peasant developed a very strong
attachment to this structure. This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was
psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and
separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much
more self-centred creature.
The new agricultural territories were not only far smaller than those of ancient
foragers, but also far more artiɹcial. Aside from the use of ɹre, hunter-gatherers
made few deliberate changes to the lands in which they roamed. Farmers, on the
other hand, lived in artificial human islands that they laboriously carved out of the
surrounding wilds. They cut down forests, dug canals, cleared ɹelds, built houses,
ploughed furrows, and planted fruit trees in tidy rows. The resulting artiɹcial
habitat was meant only for humans and ‘their’ plants and animals, and was often
fenced oʃ by walls and hedges. Farmer families did all they could to keep out

wayward weeds and wild animals. If such interlopers made their way in, they
were driven out. If they persisted, their human antagonists sought ways to
exterminate them. Particularly strong defences were erected around the home.
From the dawn of agriculture until this very day, billions of humans armed with
branches, swatters, shoes and poison sprays have waged relentless war against the
diligent ants, furtive roaches, adventurous spiders and misguided beetles that
constantly infiltrate the human domicile.
For most of history these man-made enclaves remained very small, surrounded
by expanses of untamed nature. The earth’s surface measures about 510 million
square kilometres, of which 155 million is land. As late as AD 1400, the vast
majority of farmers, along with their plants and animals, clustered together in an
area of just 11 million square kilometres – 2 per cent of the planet’s surface.2
Everywhere else was too cold, too hot, too dry, too wet, or otherwise unsuited for
cultivation. This minuscule 2 per cent of the earth’s surface constituted the stage
on which history unfolded.
People found it diɽcult to leave their artiɹcial islands. They could not abandon
their houses, ɹelds and granaries without grave risk of loss. Furthermore, as time
went on they accumulated more and more things – objects, not easily
transportable, that tied them down. Ancient farmers might seem to us dirt poor,
but a typical family possessed more artefacts than an entire forager tribe.

The Coming of the Future

While agricultural space shrank, agricultural time expanded. Foragers usually
didn’t waste much time thinking about next week or next month. Farmers sailed in
their imagination years and decades into the future.
Foragers discounted the future because they lived from hand to mouth and could
only preserve food or accumulate possessions with diɽculty. Of course, they
clearly engaged in some advanced planning. The creators of the cave paintings of
Chauvet, Lascaux and Altamira almost certainly intended them to last for
generations. Social alliances and political rivalries were long-term aʃairs. It often
took years to repay a favour or to avenge a wrong. Nevertheless, in the
subsistence economy of hunting and gathering, there was an obvious limit to such
long-term planning. Paradoxically, it saved foragers a lot of anxieties. There was
no sense in worrying about things that they could not influence.
The Agricultural Revolution made the future far more important than it had
ever been before. Farmers must always keep the future in mind and must work in
its service. The agricultural economy was based on a seasonal cycle of production,

comprising long months of cultivation followed by short peak periods of harvest.
On the night following the end of a plentiful harvest the peasants might celebrate
for all they were worth, but within a week or so they were again up at dawn for a
long day in the ɹeld. Although there was enough food for today, next week, and
even next month, they had to worry about next year and the year after that.
Concern about the future was rooted not only in seasonal cycles of production,
but also in the fundamental uncertainty of agriculture. Since most villages lived by
cultivating a very limited variety of domesticated plants and animals, they were
at the mercy of droughts, ɻoods and pestilence. Peasants were obliged to produce
more than they consumed so that they could build up reserves. Without grain in
the silo, jars of olive oil in the cellar, cheese in the pantry and sausages hanging
from the rafters, they would starve in bad years. And bad years were bound to
come, sooner or later. A peasant living on the assumption that bad years would
not come didn’t live long.
Consequently, from the very advent of agriculture, worries about the future
became major players in the theatre of the human mind. Where farmers depended
on rains to water their ɹelds, the onset of the rainy season meant that each
morning the farmers gazed towards the horizon, sniɽng the wind and straining
their eyes. Is that a cloud? Would the rains come on time? Would there be enough?
Would violent storms wash the seeds from the ɹelds and batter down seedlings?
Meanwhile, in the valleys of the Euphrates, Indus and Yellow rivers, other
peasants monitored, with no less trepidation, the height of the water. They needed
the rivers to rise in order to spread the fertile topsoil washed down from the
highlands, and to enable their vast irrigation systems to ɹll with water. But ɻoods
that surged too high or came at the wrong time could destroy their ɹelds as much
as a drought.
Peasants were worried about the future not just because they had more cause for
worry, but also because they could do something about it. They could clear
another ɹeld, dig another irrigation canal, sow more crops. The anxious peasant
was as frenetic and hardworking as a harvester ant in the summer, sweating to
plant olive trees whose oil would be pressed by his children and grandchildren,
putting oʃ until the winter or the following year the eating of the food he craved
today.
The stress of farming had far-reaching consequences. It was the foundation of
large-scale political and social systems. Sadly, the diligent peasants almost never
achieved the future economic security they so craved through their hard work in
the present. Everywhere, rulers and elites sprang up, living oʃ the peasants’
surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence.
These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. They
built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than

90 per cent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by
the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites –
kings, government oɽcials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers – who ɹll the
history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while
everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.

An Imagined Order

The food surpluses produced by peasants, coupled with new transportation
technology, eventually enabled more and more people to cram together ɹrst into
large villages, then into towns, and ɹnally into cities, all of them joined together
by new kingdoms and commercial networks.
Yet in order to take advantage of these new opportunities, food surpluses and
improved transportation were not enough. The mere fact that one can feed a
thousand people in the same town or a million people in the same kingdom does
not guarantee that they can agree how to divide the land and water, how to settle
disputes and conɻicts, and how to act in times of drought or war. And if no
agreement can be reached, strife spreads, even if the storehouses are bulging. It
was not food shortages that caused most of history’s wars and revolutions. The
French Revolution was spearheaded by aʀuent lawyers, not by famished
peasants. The Roman Republic reached the height of its power in the ɹrst century
BC, when treasure ɻeets from throughout the Mediterranean enriched the Romans
beyond their ancestors’ wildest dreams. Yet it was at that moment of maximum
aʀuence that the Roman political order collapsed into a series of deadly civil
wars. Yugoslavia in 1991 had more than enough resources to feed all its
inhabitants, and still disintegrated into a terrible bloodbath.
The problem at the root of such calamities is that humans evolved for millions of
years in small bands of a few dozen individuals. The handful of millennia
separating the Agricultural Revolution from the appearance of cities, kingdoms
and empires was not enough time to allow an instinct for mass cooperation to
evolve.
Despite the lack of such biological instincts, during the foraging era, hundreds of
strangers were able to cooperate thanks to their shared myths. However, this
cooperation was loose and limited. Every Sapiens band continued to run its life
independently and to provide for most of its own needs. An archaic sociologist
living 20,000 years ago, who had no knowledge of events following the
Agricultural Revolution, might well have concluded that mythology had a fairly
limited scope. Stories about ancestral spirits and tribal totems were strong enough

to enable 500 people to trade seashells, celebrate the odd festival, and join forces
to wipe out a Neanderthal band, but no more than that. Mythology, the ancient
sociologist would have thought, could not possibly enable millions of strangers to
cooperate on a daily basis.
But that turned out to be wrong. Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone
could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for
the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about
great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social
links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail’s pace, the human
imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any
other ever seen on earth.
Around 8500 BC the largest settlements in the world were villages such as
Jericho, which contained a few hundred individuals. By 7000 BC the town of
Çatalhöyük in Anatolia numbered between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals. It may
well have been the world’s biggest settlement at the time. During the ɹfth and
fourth millennia BC, cities with tens of thousands of inhabitants sprouted in the
Fertile Crescent, and each of these held sway over many nearby villages. In 3100
BC the entire lower Nile Valley was united into the ɹrst Egyptian kingdom. Its
pharaohs ruled thousands of square kilometres and hundreds of thousands of
people. Around 2250 BC Sargon the Great forged the ɹrst empire, the Akkadian. It
boasted over a million subjects and a standing army of 5,400 soldiers. Between
1000 BC and 500 BC, the ɹrst mega-empires appeared in the Middle East: the Late
Assyrian Empire, the Babylonian Empire, and the Persian Empire. They ruled over
many millions of subjects and commanded tens of thousands of soldiers.
In 221 BC the Qin dynasty united China, and shortly afterwards Rome united the
Mediterranean basin. Taxes levied on 40 million Qin subjects paid for a standing
army of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and a complex bureaucracy that
employed more than 100,000 oɽcials. The Roman Empire at its zenith collected
taxes from up to 100 million subjects. This revenue ɹnanced a standing army of
250,000–500,000 soldiers, a road network still in use 1,500 years later, and
theatres and amphitheatres that host spectacles to this day.

16. A stone stela inscribed with the Code of Hammurabi, c.1776 BC.

Impressive, no doubt, but we mustn’t harbour rosy illusions about ‘mass
cooperation networks’ operating in pharaonic Egypt or the Roman Empire.
‘Cooperation’ sounds very altruistic, but is not always voluntary and seldom
egalitarian. Most human cooperation networks have been geared towards
oppression and exploitation. The peasants paid for the burgeoning cooperation
networks with their precious food surpluses, despairing when the tax collector
wiped out an entire year of hard labour with a single stroke of his imperial pen.
The famed Roman amphitheatres were often built by slaves so that wealthy and
idle Romans could watch other slaves engage in vicious gladiatorial combat. Even
prisons and concentration camps are cooperation networks, and can function only
because thousands of strangers somehow manage to coordinate their actions.

17. The Declaration of Independence of the United States, signed 4 July 1776.

All these cooperation networks – from the cities of ancient Mesopotamia to the
Qin and Roman empires – were ‘imagined orders’. The social norms that sustained
them were based neither on ingrained instincts nor on personal acquaintances,
but rather on belief in shared myths.
How can myths sustain entire empires? We have already discussed one such
example: Peugeot. Now let’s examine two of the best-known myths of history: the
Code of Hammurabi of c.1776 BC, which served as a cooperation manual for
hundreds of thousands of ancient Babylonians; and the American Declaration of
Independence of 1776 AD, which today still serves as a cooperation manual for
hundreds of millions of modern Americans.
In 1776 BC Babylon was the world’s biggest city. The Babylonian Empire was
probably the world’s largest, with more than a million subjects. It ruled most of
Mesopotamia, including the bulk of modern Iraq and parts of present-day Syria
and Iran. The Babylonian king most famous today was Hammurabi. His fame is

due primarily to the text that bears his name, the Code of Hammurabi. This was a
collection of laws and judicial decisions whose aim was to present Hammurabi as
a role model of a just king, serve as a basis for a more uniform legal system across
the Babylonian Empire, and teach future generations what justice is and how a
just king acts.
Future generations took notice. The intellectual and bureaucratic elite of ancient
Mesopotamia canonised the text, and apprentice scribes continued to copy it long
after Hammurabi died and his empire lay in ruins. Hammurabi’s Code is therefore
a good source for understanding the ancient Mesopotamians’ ideal of social
order.3
The text begins by saying that the gods Anu, Enlil and Marduk – the leading
deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon – appointed Hammurabi ‘to make justice
prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to prevent the strong from
oppressing the weak’.4 It then lists about 300 judgements, given in the set formula
‘If such and such a thing happens, such is the judgment.’ For example, judgements
196–9 and 209–14 read:

196.
If a superior man should blind the eye of another superior man, they shall
blind his eye.
197.
If he should break the bone of another superior man, they shall break his
bone.

198.
If he should blind the eye of a commoner or break the bone of a
commoner, he shall weigh and deliver 60 shekels of silver.

199.
If he should blind the eye of a slave of a superior man or break the bone of
a slave of a superior man, he shall weigh and deliver one-half of the slave’s
value (in silver).5

209.
If a superior man strikes a woman of superior class and thereby causes her
to miscarry her fetus, he shall weigh and deliver ten shekels of silver for
her fetus.
210. If that woman should die, they shall kill his daughter.
211.
If he should cause a woman of commoner class to miscarry her fetus by the
beating, he shall weigh and deliver five shekels of silver.
212.
If that woman should die, he shall weigh and deliver thirty shekels of

silver.

213.
If he strikes a slave-woman of a superior man and thereby causes her to
miscarry her fetus, he shall weigh and deliver two shekels of silver.

214.
If that slave-woman should die, he shall weigh and deliver twenty shekels
of silver.6

After listing his judgements, Hammurabi again declares that
These are the just decisions which Hammurabi, the able king, has established and thereby has directed the land
along the course of truth and the correct way of life ... I am Hammurabi, noble king. I have not been careless or
negligent toward humankind, granted to my care by the god Enlil, and with whose shepherding the god Marduk
charged me.7

Hammurabi’s Code asserts that Babylonian social order is rooted in universal and
eternal principles of justice, dictated by the gods. The principle of hierarchy is of
paramount importance. According to the code, people are divided into two
genders and three classes: superior people, commoners and slaves. Members of
each gender and class have diʃerent values. The life of a female commoner is
worth thirty silver shekels and that of a slave-woman twenty silver shekels,
whereas the eye of a male commoner is worth sixty silver shekels.
The code also establishes a strict hierarchy within families, according to which
children are not independent persons, but rather the property of their parents.
Hence, if one superior man kills the daughter of another superior man, the killer’s
daughter is executed in punishment. To us it may seem strange that the killer
remains unharmed whereas his innocent daughter is killed, but to Hammurabi and
the Babylonians this seemed perfectly just. Hammurabi’s Code was based on the
premise that if the king’s subjects all accepted their positions in the hierarchy and
acted accordingly, the empire’s million inhabitants would be able to cooperate
eʃectively. Their society could then produce enough food for its members,
distribute it eɽciently, protect itself against its enemies, and expand its territory
so as to acquire more wealth and better security.
About 3,500 years after Hammurabi’s death, the inhabitants of thirteen British
colonies in North America felt that the king of England was treating them
unjustly. Their representatives gathered in the city of Philadelphia, and on 4 July
1776 the colonies declared that their inhabitants were no longer subjects of the
British Crown. Their Declaration of Independence proclaimed universal and
eternal principles of justice, which, like those of Hammurabi, were inspired by a

divine power. However, the most important principle dictated by the American
god was somewhat diʃerent from the principle dictated by the gods of Babylon.
The American Declaration of Independence asserts that:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Like Hammurabi’s Code, the American founding document promises that if
humans act according to its sacred principles, millions of them would be able to
cooperate effectively, living safely and peacefully in a just and prosperous society.
Like the Code of Hammurabi, the American Declaration of Independence was not
just a document of its time and place – it was accepted by future generations as
well. For more than 200 years, American schoolchildren have been copying and
learning it by heart.
The two texts present us with an obvious dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi
and the American Declaration of Independence claim to outline universal and
eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are equal,
whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal. The
Americans would, of course, say that they are right, and that Hammurabi is
wrong. Hammurabi, naturally, would retort that he is right, and that the
Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both wrong. Hammurabi and the American
Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable
principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where such
universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths
they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity.
It is easy for us to accept that the division of people into ‘superiors’ and
commoners’ is a ɹgment of the imagination. Yet the idea that all humans are
equal is also a myth. In what sense do all humans equal one another? Is there any
objective reality, outside the human imagination, in which we are truly equal? Are
all humans equal to one another biologically? Let us try to translate the most
famous line of the American Declaration of Independence into biological terms:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

According to the science of biology, people were not created’. They have evolved.
And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably
intertwined with the idea of creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from
Christianity, which argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that

all souls are equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian
myths about God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are
‘equal’? Evolution is based on diʃerence, not on equality. Every person carries a
somewhat diʃerent genetic code, and is exposed from birth to diʃerent
environmental inɻuences. This leads to the development of diʃerent qualities that
carry with them diʃerent chances of survival. ‘Created equal’ should therefore be
translated into ‘evolved differently’.
Just as people were never created, neither, according to the science of biology,
is there a ‘Creator’ who ‘endows’ them with anything. There is only a blind
evolutionary process, devoid of any purpose, leading to the birth of individuals.
‘Endowed by their creator’ should be translated simply into ‘born.
Equally, there are no such things as rights in biology. There are only organs,
abilities and characteristics. Birds ɻy not because they have a right to ɻy, but
because they have wings. And it’s not true that these organs, abilities and
characteristics are ‘unalienable’. Many of them undergo constant mutations, and
may well be completely lost over time. The ostrich is a bird that lost its ability to
fly. So ‘unalienable rights’ should be translated into ‘mutable characteristics’.
And what are the characteristics that evolved in humans? ‘Life’, certainly. But
‘liberty’? There is no such thing in biology. Just like equality, rights and limited
liability companies, liberty is something that people invented and that exists only
in their imagination. From a biological viewpoint, it is meaningless to say that
humans in democratic societies are free, whereas humans in dictatorships are
unfree. And what about ‘happiness’? So far biological research has failed to come
up with a clear deɹnition of happiness or a way to measure it objectively. Most
biological studies acknowledge only the existence of pleasure, which is more easily
deɹned and measured. So ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’ should be
translated into ‘life and the pursuit of pleasure’.
So here is that line from the American Declaration of Independence translated
into biological terms:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men evolved diʃerently, that they are born with certain mutable
characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.

Advocates of equality and human rights may be outraged by this line of reasoning.
Their response is likely to be, ‘We know that people are not equal biologically!
But if we believe that we are all equal in essence, it will enable us to create a
stable and prosperous society.’ I have no argument with that. This is exactly what
I mean by ‘imagined order’. We believe in a particular order not because it is
objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate eʃectively and
forge a better society. Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless

mirages. Rather, they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate
eʃectively. Bear in mind, though, that Hammurabi might have defended his
principle of hierarchy using the same logic: ‘I know that superiors, commoners
and slaves are not inherently diʃerent kinds of people. But if we believe that they
are, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’

True Believers

It’s likely that more than a few readers squirmed in their chairs while reading the
preceding paragraphs. Most of us today are educated to react in such a way. It is
easy to accept that Hammurabi’s Code was a myth, but we do not want to hear
that human rights are also a myth. If people realise that human rights exist only in
the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse? Voltaire said
about God that ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder
me at night’. Hammurabi would have said the same about his principle of
hierarchy, and Thomas Jeʃerson about human rights. Homo sapiens has no natural
rights, just as spiders, hyenas and chimpanzees have no natural rights. But don’t
tell that to our servants, lest they murder us at night.
Such fears are well justified. A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance
that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In
contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends
upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them. In order to
safeguard an imagined order, continuous and strenuous eʃorts are imperative.
Some of these eʃorts take the shape of violence and coercion. Armies, police
forces, courts and prisons are ceaselessly at work forcing people to act in
accordance with the imagined order. If an ancient Babylonian blinded his
neighbour, some violence was usually necessary in order to enforce the law of ‘an
eye for an eye’. When, in 1860, a majority of American citizens concluded that
African slaves are human beings and must therefore enjoy the right of liberty, it
took a bloody civil war to make the southern states acquiesce.
However, an imagined order cannot be sustained by violence alone. It requires
some true believers as well. Prince Talleyrand, who began his chameleon-like
career under Louis XVI, later served the revolutionary and Napoleonic regimes,
and switched loyalties in time to end his days working for the restored monarchy,
summed up decades of governmental experience by saying that ‘You can do many
things with bayonets, but it is rather uncomfortable to sit on them.’ A single priest
often does the work of a hundred soldiers far more cheaply and eʃectively.
Moreover, no matter how eɽcient bayonets are, somebody must wield them. Why

should the soldiers, jailors, judges and police maintain an imagined order in which
they do not believe? Of all human collective activities, the one most diɽcult to
organise is violence. To say that a social order is maintained by military force
immediately raises the question: what maintains the military order? It is
impossible to organise an army solely by coercion. At least some of the
commanders and soldiers must truly believe in something, be it God, honour,
motherland, manhood or money.
An even more interesting question concerns those standing at the top of the
social pyramid. Why should they wish to enforce an imagined order if they
themselves don’t believe in it? It is quite common to argue that the elite may do so
out of cynical greed. Yet a cynic who believes in nothing is unlikely to be greedy.
It does not take much to provide the objective biological needs of Homo sapiens.
After those needs are met, more money can be spent on building pyramids, taking
holidays around the world, ɹnancing election campaigns, funding your favourite
terrorist organisation, or investing in the stock market and making yet more
money – all of which are activities that a true cynic would ɹnd utterly
meaningless. Diogenes, the Greek philosopher who founded the Cynical school,
lived in a barrel. When Alexander the Great once visited Diogenes as he was
relaxing in the sun, and asked if there were anything he might do for him, the
Cynic answered the all-powerful conqueror, ‘Yes, there is something you can do
for me. Please move a little to the side. You are blocking the sunlight.’
This is why cynics don’t build empires and why an imagined order can be
maintained only if large segments of the population – and in particular large
segments of the elite and the security forces – truly believe in it. Christianity
would not have lasted 2,000 years if the majority of bishops and priests failed to
believe in Christ. American democracy would not have lasted 250 years if the
majority of presidents and congressmen failed to believe in human rights. The
modern economic system would not have lasted a single day if the majority of
investors and bankers failed to believe in capitalism.

The Prison Walls

How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity,
democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined. You
always insist that the order sustaining society is an objective reality created by the
great gods or by the laws of nature. People are unequal, not because Hammurabi
said so, but because Enlil and Marduk decreed it. People are equal, not because
Thomas Jeʃerson said so, but because God created them that way. Free markets

are the best economic system, not because Adam Smith said so, but because these
are the immutable laws of nature.
You also educate people thoroughly. From the moment they are born, you
constantly remind them of the principles of the imagined order, which are
incorporated into anything and everything. They are incorporated into fairy tales,
dramas, paintings, songs, etiquette, political propaganda, architecture, recipes
and fashions. For example, today people believe in equality, so it’s fashionable for
rich kids to wear jeans, which were originally working-class attire. In the Middle
Ages people believed in class divisions, so no young nobleman would have worn a
peasant’s smock. Back then, to be addressed as ‘Sir’ or ‘Madam’ was a rare
privilege reserved for the nobility, and often purchased with blood. Today all
polite correspondence, regardless of the recipient, begins with ‘Dear Sir or
Madam’.
The humanities and social sciences devote most of their energies to explaining
exactly how the imagined order is woven into the tapestry of life. In the limited
space at our disposal we can only scratch the surface. Three main factors prevent
people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their
imagination:

a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world. Though the
imagined order exists only in our minds, it can be woven into the material reality
around us, and even set in stone. Most Westerners today believe in individualism.
They believe that every human is an individual, whose worth does not depend on
what other people think of him or her. Each of us has within ourselves a brilliant
ray of light that gives value and meaning to our lives. In modern Western schools
teachers and parents tell children that if their classmates make fun of them, they
should ignore it. Only they themselves, not others, know their true worth.
In modern architecture, this myth leaps out of the imagination to take shape in
stone and mortar. The ideal modern house is divided into many small rooms so
that each child can have a private space, hidden from view, providing for
maximum autonomy. This private room almost invariably has a door, and in
many households it is accepted practice for the child to close, and perhaps lock,
the door. Even parents are forbidden to enter without knocking and asking
permission. The room is decorated as the child sees ɹt, with rock-star posters on
the wall and dirty socks on the ɻoor. Somebody growing up in such a space
cannot help but imagine himself ‘an individual’, his true worth emanating from
within rather than from without.
Medieval noblemen did not believe in individualism. Someone’s worth was
determined by their place in the social hierarchy, and by what other people said
about them. Being laughed at was a horrible indignity. Noblemen taught their

children to protect their good name whatever the cost. Like modern individualism,
the medieval value system left the imagination and was manifested in the stone of
medieval castles. The castle rarely contained private rooms for children (or
anyone else, for that matter). The teenage son of a medieval baron did not have a
private room on the castle’s second ɻoor, with posters of Richard the Lionheart
and King Arthur on the walls and a locked door that his parents were not allowed
to open. He slept alongside many other youths in a large hall. He was always on
display and always had to take into account what others saw and said. Someone
growing up in such conditions naturally concluded that a man’s true worth was
determined by his place in the social hierarchy and by what other people said of
him.8

b. The imagined order shapes our desires. Most people do not wish to accept
that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born
into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by
its dominant myths. Our personal desires thereby become the imagined order’s
most important defences.
For instance, the most cherished desires of present-day Westerners are shaped
by romantic, nationalist, capitalist and humanist myths that have been around for
centuries. Friends giving advice often tell each other, ‘Follow your heart.’ But the
heart is a double agent that usually takes its instructions from the dominant myths
of the day, and the very recommendation to ‘Follow your heart’ was implanted in

our minds by a combination of nineteenth-century Romantic myths and twentieth-
century consumerist myths. The Coca-Cola Company, for example, has marketed

Diet Coke around the world under the slogan, ‘Diet Coke. Do what feels good.’
Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually
programmed by the imagined order. Let’s consider, for example, the popular
desire to take a holiday abroad. There is nothing natural or obvious about this. A
chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on
holiday into the territory of a neighbouring chimpanzee band. The elite of ancient
Egypt spent their fortunes building pyramids and having their corpses mummiɹed,
but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylon or taking a skiing holiday
in Phoenicia. People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad
because they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism.
Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we
must have as many diʃerent experiences as we can. We must open ourselves to a
wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample various kinds of relationships; we
must try diʃerent cuisines; we must learn to appreciate diʃerent styles of music.
One of the best ways to do all that is to break free from our daily routine, leave
behind our familiar setting, and go travelling in distant lands, where we can

‘experience’ the culture, the smells, the tastes and the norms of other people. We
hear again and again the romantic myths about ‘how a new experience opened
my eyes and changed my life’.
Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many
products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite
right, then we probably need to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food)
or a service (housekeeping, relationship therapy, yoga classes). Every television
commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service
will make life better.
Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism.
Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‘market of experiences’, on which the
modern tourism industry is founded. The tourism industry does not sell ɻight
tickets and hotel bedrooms. It sells experiences. Paris is not a city, nor India a
country – they are both experiences, the consumption of which is supposed to
widen our horizons, fulɹl our human potential, and make us happier.
Consequently, when the relationship between a millionaire and his wife is going
through a rocky patch, he takes her on an expensive trip to Paris. The trip is not a
reɻection of some independent desire, but rather of an ardent belief in the myths
of romantic consumerism. A wealthy man in ancient Egypt would never have
dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon.
Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.

18. The Great Pyramid of Giza. The kind of thing rich people in ancient Egypt did with their money.

Like the elite of ancient Egypt, most people in most cultures dedicate their lives
to building pyramids. Only the names, shapes and sizes of these pyramids change

from one culture to the other. They may take the form, for example, of a suburban
cottage with a swimming pool and an evergreen lawn, or a gleaming penthouse
with an enviable view. Few question the myths that cause us to desire the pyramid
in the first place.

c. The imagined order is inter-subjective. Even if by some superhuman eʃort I
succeed in freeing my personal desires from the grip of the imagined order, I am
just one person. In order to change the imagined order I must convince millions of
strangers to cooperate with me. For the imagined order is not a subjective order
existing in my own imagination – it is rather an inter-subjective order, existing in
the shared imagination of thousands and millions of people.
In order to understand this, we need to understand the diʃerence between
‘objective’, ‘subjective’, and ‘inter-subjective’.
A n objective phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and
human beliefs. Radioactivity, for example, is not a myth. Radioactive emissions
occurred long before people discovered them, and they are dangerous even when
people do not believe in them. Marie Curie, one of the discoverers of radioactivity,
did not know, during her long years of studying radioactive materials, that they
could harm her body. While she did not believe that radioactivity could kill her,
she nevertheless died of aplastic anaemia, a disease caused by overexposure to
radioactive materials.
The subjective is something that exists depending on the consciousness and
beliefs of a single individual. It disappears or changes if that particular individual
changes his or her beliefs. Many a child believes in the existence of an imaginary
friend who is invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world. The imaginary friend
exists solely in the child’s subjective consciousness, and when the child grows up
and ceases to believe in it, the imaginary friend fades away.
T h e inter-subjective is something that exists within the communication
network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single
individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.

However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-
subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear. Inter-subjective phenomena are

neither malevolent frauds nor insigniɹcant charades. They exist in a diʃerent way
from physical phenomena such as radioactivity, but their impact on the world may
still be enormous. Many of history’s most important drivers are inter-subjective:
law, money, gods, nations.
Peugeot, for example, is not the imaginary friend of Peugeot’s CEO. The
company exists in the shared imagination of millions of people. The CEO believes
in the company’s existence because the board of directors also believes in it, as do
the company’s lawyers, the secretaries in the nearby oɽce, the tellers in the bank,

the brokers on the stock exchange, and car dealers from France to Australia. If the
CEO alone were suddenly to stop believing in Peugeot’s existence, he’d quickly
land in the nearest mental hospital and someone else would occupy his office.
Similarly, the dollar, human rights and the United States of America exist in the
shared imagination of billions, and no single individual can threaten their
existence. If I alone were to stop believing in the dollar, in human rights, or in the

United States, it wouldn’t much matter. These imagined orders are inter-
subjective, so in order to change them we must simultaneously change the

consciousness of billions of people, which is not easy. A change of such magnitude
can be accomplished only with the help of a complex organisation, such as a
political party, an ideological movement, or a religious cult. However, in order to
establish such complex organisations, it’s necessary to convince many strangers to
cooperate with one another. And this will happen only if these strangers believe
in some shared myths. It follows that in order to change an existing imagined
order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.
In order to dismantle Peugeot, for example, we need to imagine something
more powerful, such as the French legal system. In order to dismantle the French
legal system we need to imagine something even more powerful, such as the
French state. And if we would like to dismantle that too, we will have to imagine
something yet more powerful.
There is no way out of the imagined order. When we break down our prison
walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious
exercise yard of a bigger prison.

Memory Overload

EVOLUTION DID NOT ENDOW HUMANS with the ability to play football. True, it
produced legs for kicking, elbows for fouling and mouths for cursing, but all that
this enables us to do is perhaps practise penalty kicks by ourselves. To get into a
game with the strangers we ɹnd in the schoolyard on any given afternoon, we not
only have to work in concert with ten teammates we may never have met before,
we also need to know that the eleven players on the opposing team are playing
by the same rules. Other animals that engage strangers in ritualised aggression do

so largely by instinct – puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough-and-
tumble play hard-wired into their genes. But human teenagers have no genes for

football. They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because
they have all learned an identical set of ideas about football. These ideas are
entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game.
The same applies, on a larger scale, to kingdoms, churches and trade networks,
with one important diʃerence. The rules of football are relatively simple and
concise, much like those necessary for cooperation in a forager band or small
village. Each player can easily store them in his brain and still have room for
songs, images and shopping lists. But large systems of cooperation that involve
not twenty-two but thousands or even millions of humans require the handling
and storage of huge amounts of information, much more than any single human
brain can contain and process.
The large societies found in some other species, such as ants and bees, are stable
and resilient because most of the information needed to sustain them is encoded in
the genome. A female honeybee larva can, for example, grow up to be either a
queen or a worker, depending on what food it is fed. Its DNA programmes the
necessary behaviours for whatever role it will fulɹl in life. Hives can be very
complex social structures, containing many diʃerent kinds of workers, such as
harvesters, nurses and cleaners. But so far researchers have failed to locate lawyer
bees. Bees don’t need lawyers, because there is no danger that they might forget
or violate the hive constitution. The queen does not cheat the cleaner bees of their
food, and they never go on strike demanding higher wages.
But humans do such things all the time. Because the Sapiens social order is

imagined, humans cannot preserve the critical information for running it simply
by making copies of their DNA and passing these on to their progeny. A conscious
eʃort has to be made to sustain laws, customs, procedures and manners, otherwise
the social order would quickly collapse. For example, King Hammurabi decreed
that people are divided into superiors, commoners and slaves. Unlike the beehive
class system, this is not a natural division – there is no trace of it in the human
genome. If the Babylonians could not keep this ‘truth’ in mind, their society would
have ceased to function. Similarly, when Hammurabi passed his DNA to his
oʃspring, it did not encode his ruling that a superior man who killed a commoner
woman must pay thirty silver shekels. Hammurabi deliberately had to instruct his
sons in the laws of his empire, and his sons and grandsons had to do the same.
Empires generate huge amounts of information. Beyond laws, empires have to
keep accounts of transactions and taxes, inventories of military supplies and
merchant vessels, and calendars of festivals and victories. For millions of years
people stored information in a single place – their brains. Unfortunately, the
human brain is not a good storage device for empire-sized databases, for three
main reasons.
First, its capacity is limited. True, some people have astonishing memories, and
in ancient times there were memory professionals who could store in their heads
the topographies of whole provinces and the law codes of entire states.
Nevertheless, there is a limit that even master mnemonists cannot transcend. A
lawyer might know by heart the entire law code of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, but not the details of every legal proceeding that took place in
Massachusetts from the Salem witch trials onward.
Secondly, humans die, and their brains die with them. Any information stored in
a brain will be erased in less than a century. It is, of course, possible to pass
memories from one brain to another, but after a few transmissions, the
information tends to get garbled or lost.
Thirdly and most importantly, the human brain has been adapted to store and

process only particular types of information. In order to survive, ancient hunter-
gatherers had to remember the shapes, qualities and behaviour patterns of

thousands of plant and animal species. They had to remember that a wrinkled
yellow mushroom growing in autumn under an elm tree is most probably
poisonous, whereas a similar-looking mushroom growing in winter under an oak
tree is a good stomach-ache remedy. Hunter-gatherers also had to bear in mind the
opinions and relations of several dozen band members. If Lucy needed a band
member’s help to get John to stop harassing her, it was important for her to
remember that John had fallen out last week with Mary, who would thus be a
likely and enthusiastic ally. Consequently, evolutionary pressures have adapted
the human brain to store immense quantities of botanical, zoological,

topographical and social information.
But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the
Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital –
numbers. Foragers were never obliged to handle large amounts of mathematical
data. No forager needed to remember, say, the number of fruit on each tree in the
forest. So human brains did not adapt to storing and processing numbers. Yet in
order to maintain a large kingdom, mathematical data was vital. It was never
enough to legislate laws and tell stories about guardian gods. One also had to
collect taxes. In order to tax hundreds of thousands of people, it was imperative to
collect data about peoples incomes and possessions; data about payments made;
data about arrears, debts and ɹnes; data about discounts and exemptions. This
added up to millions of data bits, which had to be stored and processed. Without
this capacity, the state would never know what resources it had and what further
resources it could tap. When confronted with the need to memorise, recall and
handle all these numbers, most human brains overdosed or fell asleep.
This mental limitation severely constrained the size and complexity of human
collectives. When the amount of people and property in a particular society
crossed a critical threshold, it became necessary to store and process large
amounts of mathematical data. Since the human brain could not do it, the system
collapsed. For thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution, human social
networks remained relatively small and simple.
The ɹrst to overcome the problem were the ancient Sumerians, who lived in
southern Mesopotamia. There, a scorching sun beating upon rich muddy plains
produced plentiful harvests and prosperous towns. As the number of inhabitants
grew, so did the amount of information required to coordinate their aʃairs.
Between the years 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some unknown Sumerian geniuses
invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains, one
that was custom-built to handle large amounts of mathematical data. The
Sumerians thereby released their social order from the limitations of the human
brain, opening the way for the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires. The
data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called ‘writing’.

Signed, Kushim

Writing is a method for storing information through material signs. The Sumerian
writing system did so by combining two types of signs, which were pressed in clay
tablets. One type of signs represented numbers. There were signs for 1, 10, 60,
600, 3,600 and 36,000. (The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10

numeral systems. Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies,
such as the division of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360
degrees.) The other type of signs represented people, animals, merchandise,
territories, dates and so forth. By combining both types of signs the Sumerians
were able to preserve far more data than any human brain could remember or
any DNA chain could encode.

19. A clay tablet with an administrative text from the city of Uruk, c.3400–3000 BC. ‘Kushim’ may be the
generic title of an officeholder, or the name of a particular individual. If Kushim was indeed a person, he
may be the first individual in history whose name is known to us! All the names applied earlier in human
history – the Neanderthals, the Natufians, Chauvet Cave, Göbekli Tepe – are modern inventions. We have
no idea what the builders of Göbekli Tepe actually called the place. With the appearance of writing, we
are beginning to hear history through the ears of its protagonists. When Kushim’s neighbours called out
to him, they might really have shouted ‘Kushim!’ It is telling that the first recorded name in history

belongs to an accountant, rather than a prophet, a poet or a great conqueror.1

At this early stage, writing was limited to facts and ɹgures. The great Sumerian
novel, if there ever was one, was never committed to clay tablets. Writing was
time-consuming and the reading public tiny, so no one saw any reason to use it
for anything other than essential record-keeping. If we look for the ɹrst words of
wisdom reaching us from our ancestors, 5,000 years ago, we’re in for a big
disappointment. The earliest messages our ancestors have left us read, for
example, ‘29,086 measures barley 37 months Kushim.’ The most probable reading
of this sentence is: ‘A total of 29,086 measures of barley were received over the
course of 37 months. Signed, Kushim.’ Alas, the ɹrst texts of history contain no
philosophical insights, no poetry, legends, laws, or even royal triumphs. They are

humdrum economic documents, recording the payment of taxes, the accumulation
of debts and the ownership of property.

Partial script cannot express the entire spectrum of a spoken language, but it can express things that fall
outside the scope of spoken language. Partial scripts such as the Sumerian and mathematical scripts

cannot be used to write poetry, but they can keep tax accounts very effectively.

Only one other type of text survived from these ancient days, and it is even less
exciting: lists of words, copied over and over again by apprentice scribes as
training exercises. Even had a bored student wanted to write out some of his
poems instead of copy a bill of sale, he could not have done so. The earliest
Sumerian writing was a partial rather than a full script. Full script is a system of
material signs that can represent spoken language more or less completely. It can
therefore express everything people can say, including poetry. Partial script, on
the other hand, is a system of material signs that can represent only particular
types of information, belonging to a limited ɹeld of activity. Latin script, ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphics and Braille are full scripts. You can use them to write tax
registers, love poems, history books, food recipes and business law. In contrast,
the earliest Sumerian script, like modern mathematical symbols and musical
notation, are partial scripts. You can use mathematical script to make
calculations, but you cannot use it to write love poems.

20. A man holding a quipu, as depicted in a Spanish manuscript following the fall of the Inca Empire.

It didn’t disturb the Sumerians that their script was ill-suited for writing poetry.
They didn’t invent it in order to copy spoken language, but rather to do things

that spoken language failed at. There were some cultures, such as those of the pre-
Columbian Andes, which used only partial scripts throughout their entire histories,

unfazed by their scripts’ limitations and feeling no need for a full version. Andean
script was very diʃerent from its Sumerian counterpart. In fact, it was so diʃerent
that many people would argue it wasn’t a script at all. It was not written on clay
tablets or pieces of paper. Rather, it was written by tying knots on colourful cords
called quipus. Each quipu consisted of many cords of diʃerent colours, made of
wool or cotton. On each cord, several knots were tied in diʃerent places. A single
quipu could contain hundreds of cords and thousands of knots. By combining
diʃerent knots on diʃerent cords with diʃerent colours, it was possible to record
large amounts of mathematical data relating to, for example, tax collection and
property ownership.2
For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, quipus were essential to the business
of cities, kingdoms and empires.3 They reached their full potential under the Inca
Empire, which ruled 10–12 million people and covered today’s Peru, Ecuador and
Bolivia, as well as chunks of Chile, Argentina and Colombia. Thanks to quipus, the
Incas could save and process large amounts of data, without which they would not

have been able to maintain the complex administrative machinery that an empire
of that size requires.
In fact, quipus were so eʃective and accurate that in the early years following
the Spanish conquest of South America, the Spaniards themselves employed quipus
in the work of administering their new empire. The problem was that the
Spaniards did not themselves know how to record and read quipus, making them
dependent on local professionals. The continent’s new rulers realised that this
placed them in a tenuous position – the native quipu experts could easily mislead
and cheat their overlords. So once Spain’s dominion was more ɹrmly established,
quipus were phased out and the new empire’s records were kept entirely in Latin
script and numerals. Very few quipus survived the Spanish occupation, and most
of those remaining are undecipherable, since, unfortunately, the art of reading
quipus has been lost.

The Wonders of Bureaucracy

The Mesopotamians eventually started to want to write down things other than
monotonous mathematical data. Between 3000 BC and 2500 BC more and more
signs were added to the Sumerian system, gradually transforming it into a full
script that we today call cuneiform. By 2500 BC, kings were using cuneiform to
issue decrees, priests were using it to record oracles, and less exalted citizens were
using it to write personal letters. At roughly the same time, Egyptians developed
another full script known as hieroglyphics. Other full scripts were developed in
China around 1200 BC and in Central America around 1000–500 BC.
From these initial centres, full scripts spread far and wide, taking on various
new forms and novel tasks. People began to write poetry, history books,
romances, dramas, prophecies and cookbooks. Yet writing’s most important task
continued to be the storage of reams of mathematical data, and that task
remained the prerogative of partial script. The Hebrew Bible, the Greek Iliad, the
Hindu Mahabharata and the Buddhist Tipitika all began as oral works. For many
generations they were transmitted orally and would have lived on even had
writing never been invented. But tax registries and complex bureaucracies were
born together with partial script, and the two remain inexorably linked to this day
like Siamese twins – think of the cryptic entries in computerised data bases and
spreadsheets.
As more and more things were written, and particularly as administrative
archives grew to huge proportions, new problems appeared. Information stored in
a persons brain is easy to retrieve. My brain stores billions of bits of data, yet I

can quickly, almost instantaneously, recall the name of Italy’s capital,
immediately afterwards recollect what I did on 11 September 2001, and then
reconstruct the route leading from my house to the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem. Exactly how the brain does it remains a mystery, but we all know that
the brain’s retrieval system is amazingly eɽcient, except when you are trying to
remember where you put your car keys.
How, though, do you find and retrieve information stored on quipu cords or clay
tablets? If you have just ten tablets or a hundred tablets, it’s not a problem. But
what if you have accumulated thousands of them, as did one of Hammurabi’s
contemporaries, King Zimrilim of Mari?
Imagine for a moment that it’s 1776 BC. Two Marians are quarrelling over
possession of a wheat ɹeld. Jacob insists that he bought the ɹeld from Esau thirty
years ago. Esau retorts that he in fact rented the ɹeld to Jacob for a term of thirty
years, and that now, the term being up, he intends to reclaim it. They shout and
wrangle and start pushing one another before they realise that they can resolve
their dispute by going to the royal archive, where are housed the deeds and bills of
sale that apply to all the kingdom’s real estate. Upon arriving at the archive they
are shuttled from one oɽcial to the other. They wait through several herbal tea
breaks, are told to come back tomorrow, and eventually are taken by a grumbling
clerk to look for the relevant clay tablet. The clerk opens a door and leads them
into a huge room lined, ɻoor to ceiling, with thousands of clay tablets. No wonder
the clerk is sour-faced. How is he supposed to locate the deed to the disputed
wheat ɹeld written thirty years ago? Even if he ɹnds it, how will he be able to
cross-check to ensure that the one from thirty years ago is the latest document
relating to the ɹeld in question? If he can’t ɹnd it, does that prove that Esau never
sold or rented out the ɹeld? Or just that the document got lost, or turned to mush
when some rain leaked into the archive?
Clearly, just imprinting a document in clay is not enough to guarantee eɽcient,
accurate and convenient data processing. That requires methods of organisation
like catalogues, methods of reproduction like photocopy machines, methods of
rapid and accurate retrieval like computer algorithms, and pedantic (but hopefully
cheerful) librarians who know how to use these tools.
Inventing such methods proved to be far more diɽcult than inventing writing.
Many writing systems developed independently in cultures distant in time and
place from each other. Every decade archaeologists discover another few forgotten
scripts. Some of them might prove to be even older than the Sumerian scratches in
clay. But most of them remain curiosities because those who invented them failed
to invent eɽcient ways of cataloguing and retrieving data. What set apart Sumer,
as well as pharaonic Egypt, ancient China and the Inca Empire, is that these
cultures developed good techniques of archiving, cataloguing and retrieving

written records. They also invested in schools for scribes, clerks, librarians and
accountants.
A writing exercise from a school in ancient Mesopotamia discovered by modern
archaeologists gives us a glimpse into the lives of these students, some 4,000 years
ago:
I went in and sat down, and my teacher read my tablet. He said, ‘There’s something missing!’
And he caned me.
One of the people in charge said, ‘Why did you open your mouth without my permission?’
And he caned me.
The one in charge of rules said, ‘Why did you get up without my permission?’
And he caned me.
The gatekeeper said, ‘Why are you going out without my permission?’ And he caned me.
The keeper of the beer jug said, ‘Why did you get some without my permission?’
And he caned me.
The Sumerian teacher said, ‘Why did you speak Akkadian?’
*

And he caned me.
My teacher said, ‘Your handwriting is no good!’
And he caned me.4

Ancient scribes learned not merely to read and write, but also to use catalogues,
dictionaries, calendars, forms and tables. They studied and internalised techniques
of cataloguing, retrieving and processing information very diʃerent from those
used by the brain. In the brain, all data is freely associated. When I go with my
spouse to sign on a mortgage for our new home, I am reminded of the ɹrst place
we lived together, which reminds me of our honeymoon in New Orleans, which
reminds me of alligators, which remind me of dragons, which remind me of The
Ring of the Nibelungen, and suddenly, before I know it, there I am humming the
Siegfried leitmotif to a puzzled bank clerk. In bureaucracy, things must be kept
apart. There is one drawer for home mortgages, another for marriage certiɹcates,
a third for tax registers, and a fourth for lawsuits. Otherwise, how can you ɹnd
anything? Things that belong in more than one drawer, like Wagnerian music
dramas (do I ɹle them under ‘music’, ‘theatre’, or perhaps invent a new category
altogether?), are a terrible headache. So one is forever adding, deleting and
rearranging drawers.
In order to function, the people who operate such a system of drawers must be
reprogrammed to stop thinking as humans and to start thinking as clerks and
accountants. As everyone from ancient times till today knows, clerks and
accountants think in a non-human fashion. They think like ɹling cabinets. This is
not their fault. If they don’t think that way their drawers will all get mixed up and

they won’t be able to provide the services their government, company or
organisation requires. The most important impact of script on human history is
precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world.
Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and
bureaucracy.

The Language of Numbers

As the centuries passed, bureaucratic methods of data processing grew ever more
diʃerent from the way humans naturally think – and ever more important. A
critical step was made sometime before the ninth century AD, when a new partial
script was invented, one that could store and process mathematical data with
unprecedented eɽciency. This partial script was composed of ten signs,
representing the numbers from 0 to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as
Arabic numerals even though they were ɹrst invented by the Hindus (even more
confusingly, modern Arabs use a set of digits that look quite diʃerent from
Western ones). But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they
encountered the system, understood its usefulness, reɹned it, and spread it
through the Middle East and then to Europe. When several other signs were later
added to the Arab numerals (such as the signs for addition, subtraction and
multiplication), the basis of modern mathematical notation came into being.
Although this system of writing remains a partial script, it has become the
world’s dominant language. Almost all states, companies, organisations and
institutions – whether they speak Arabic, Hindi, English or Norwegian – use
mathematical script to record and process data. Every piece of information that
can be translated into mathematical script is stored, spread and processed with
mind-boggling speed and efficiency.
A person who wishes to inɻuence the decisions of governments, organisations
and companies must therefore learn to speak in numbers. Experts do their best to
translate even ideas such as ‘poverty’, ‘happiness’ and ‘honesty’ into numbers (‘the
poverty line’, ‘subjective well-being levels’, ‘credit rating’). Entire ɹelds of
knowledge, such as physics and engineering, have already lost almost all touch
with the spoken human language, and are maintained solely by mathematical
script.

An equation for calculating the acceleration of mass i under the influence of gravity, according to the
Theory of Relativity. When most laypeople see such an equation, they usually panic and freeze, like a
deer caught in the headlights of a speeding vehicle. The reaction is quite natural, and does not betray a
lack of intelligence or curiosity. With rare exceptions, human brains are simply incapable of thinking
through concepts like relativity and quantum mechanics. Physicists nevertheless manage to do so,
because they set aside the traditional human way of thinking, and learn to think anew with the help of
external data-processing systems. Crucial parts of their thought process take place not in the head, but

inside computers or on classroom blackboards.

More recently, mathematical script has given rise to an even more
revolutionary writing system, a computerised binary script consisting of only two
signs: 0 and 1. The words I am now typing on my keyboard are written within my
computer by different combinations of 0 and 1.
Writing was born as the maidservant of human consciousness, but is increasingly
becoming its master. Our computers have trouble understanding how Homo
sapiens talks, feels and dreams. So we are teaching Homo sapiens to talk, feel and
dream in the language of numbers, which can be understood by computers.
And this is not the end of the story. The ɹeld of artiɹcial intelligence is seeking
to create a new kind of intelligence based solely on the binary script of computers.
Science-ɹction movies such as The Matrix and The Terminator tell of a day when
the binary script throws oʃ the yoke of humanity. When humans try to regain
control of the rebellious script, it responds by attempting to wipe out the human
race.

* Even after Akkadian became the spoken language, Sumerian remained the language of administration and thus

the language recorded with writing. Aspiring scribes thus had to speak Sumerian.

There is No Justice in History

UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HISTORY IN THE millennia following the Agricultural
Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves
in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary
to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined
orders and devised scripts. These two inventions ɹlled the gaps left by our
biological inheritance.
However, the appearance of these networks was, for many, a dubious blessing.
The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither neutral nor fair. They
divided people into make-believe groups, arranged in a hierarchy. The upper
levels enjoyed privileges and power, while the lower ones suʃered from
discrimination and oppression. Hammurabi’s Code, for example, established a
pecking order of superiors, commoners and slaves. Superiors got all the good
things in life. Commoners got what was left. Slaves got a beating if they
complained.
Despite its proclamation of the equality of all men, the imagined order
established by the Americans in 1776 also established a hierarchy. It created a
hierarchy between men, who beneɹted from it, and women, whom it left
disempowered. It created a hierarchy between whites, who enjoyed liberty, and
blacks and American Indians, who were considered humans of a lesser type and
therefore did not share in the equal rights of men. Many of those who signed the
Declaration of Independence were slaveholders. They did not release their slaves
upon signing the Declaration, nor did they consider themselves hypocrites. In their
view, the rights of men had little to do with Negroes.
The American order also consecrated the hierarchy between rich and poor. Most
Americans at that time had little problem with the inequality caused by wealthy
parents passing their money and businesses on to their children. In their view,
equality meant simply that the same laws applied to rich and poor. It had nothing
to do with unemployment beneɹts, integrated education or health insurance.
Liberty, too, carried very diʃerent connotations than it does today. In 1776, it did
not mean that the disempowered (certainly not blacks or Indians or, God forbid,
women) could gain and exercise power. It meant simply that the state could not,

except in unusual circumstances, conɹscate a citizen’s private property or tell him
what to do with it. The American order thereby upheld the hierarchy of wealth,
which some thought was mandated by God and others viewed as representing the
immutable laws of nature. Nature, it was claimed, rewarded merit with wealth
while penalising indolence.
All the above-mentioned distinctions – between free persons and slaves,
between whites and blacks, between rich and poor – are rooted in ɹctions. (The
hierarchy of men and women will be discussed later.) Yet it is an iron rule of
history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its ɹctional origins and claims to
be natural and inevitable. For instance, many people who have viewed the
hierarchy of free persons and slaves as natural and correct have argued that
slavery is not a human invention. Hammurabi saw it as ordained by the gods.
Aristotle argued that slaves have a ‘slavish nature’ whereas free people have a
‘free nature’. Their status in society is merely a reflection of their innate nature.
Ask white supremacists about the racial hierarchy, and you are in for a
pseudoscientiɹc lecture concerning the biological diʃerences between the races.
You are likely to be told that there is something in Caucasian blood or genes that
makes whites naturally more intelligent, moral and hardworking. Ask a diehard
capitalist about the hierarchy of wealth, and you are likely to hear that it is the
inevitable outcome of objective diʃerences in abilities. The rich have more money,
in this view, because they are more capable and diligent. No one should be
bothered, then, if the wealthy get better health care, better education and better
nutrition. The rich richly deserve every perk they enjoy.

People with lighter skin colour are typically more in danger of sunburn than people with darker skin. Yet

there was no biological logic behind the division of South African beaches. Beaches reserved for people

with lighter skin were not characterised by lower levels of ultraviolet radiation.

Hindus who adhere to the caste system believe that cosmic forces have made
one caste superior to another. According to a famous Hindu creation myth, the
gods fashioned the world out of the body of a primeval being, the Purusa. The sun
was created from the Purusa’s eye, the moon from the Purusa’s brain, the
Brahmins (priests) from its mouth, the Kshatriyas (warriors) from its arms, the
Vaishyas (peasants and merchants) from its thighs, and the Shudras (servants)
from its legs. Accept this explanation and the sociopolitical diʃerences between
Brahmins and Shudras are as natural and eternal as the diʃerences between the
sun and the moon.1 The ancient Chinese believed that when the goddess Nü Wa
created humans from earth, she kneaded aristocrats from ɹne yellow soil, whereas
commoners were formed from brown mud.2
Yet, to the best of our understanding, these hierarchies are all the product of
human imagination. Brahmins and Shudras were not really created by the gods
from different body parts of a primeval being. Instead, the distinction between the
two castes was created by laws and norms invented by humans in northern India
about 3,000 years ago. Contrary to Aristotle, there is no known biological
diʃerence between slaves and free people. Human laws and norms have turned
some people into slaves and others into masters. Between blacks and whites there
are some objective biological diʃerences, such as skin colour and hair type, but
there is no evidence that the differences extend to intelligence or morality.
Most people claim that their social hierarchy is natural and just, while those of
other societies are based on false and ridiculous criteria. Modern Westerners are
taught to scoʃ at the idea of racial hierarchy. They are shocked by laws
prohibiting blacks to live in white neighbourhoods, or to study in white schools, or
to be treated in white hospitals. But the hierarchy of rich and poor – which
mandates that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods,
study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in
separate and better-equipped facilities – seems perfectly sensible to many
Americans and Europeans. Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for
the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people
will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor
family.
Unfortunately, complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies and
unjust discrimination. Of course not all hierarchies are morally identical, and
some societies suʃered from more extreme types of discrimination than others, yet
scholars know of no large society that has been able to dispense with

discrimination altogether. Time and again people have created order in their
societies by classifying the population into imagined categories, such as superiors,
commoners and slaves; whites and blacks; patricians and plebeians; Brahmins and
Shudras; or rich and poor. These categories have regulated relations between
millions of humans by making some people legally, politically or socially superior
to others.
Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to
know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to
become personally acquainted. In George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, Henry
Higgins doesn’t need to establish an intimate acquaintance with Eliza Doolittle in
order to understand how he should relate to her. Just hearing her talk tells him
that she is a member of the underclass with whom he can do as he wishes – for
example, using her as a pawn in his bet to pass oʃ a ɻower girl as a duchess. A
modern Eliza working at a ɻorist’s needs to know how much eʃort to put into
selling roses and gladioli to the dozens of people who enter the shop each day. She
can’t make a detailed enquiry into the tastes and wallets of each individual.
Instead, she uses social cues – the way the person is dressed, his or her age, and if
she’s not politically correct his skin colour. That is how she immediately
distinguishes between the accounting-ɹrm partner who’s likely to place a large
order for expensive roses, and a messenger boy who can only aʃord a bunch of
daisies.
Of course, diʃerences in natural abilities also play a role in the formation of
social distinctions. But such diversities of aptitudes and character are usually
mediated through imagined hierarchies. This happens in two important ways. First
and foremost, most abilities have to be nurtured and developed. Even if somebody
is born with a particular talent, that talent will usually remain latent if it is not
fostered, honed and exercised. Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and
reɹne their abilities. Whether or not they have such an opportunity will usually
depend on their place within their society’s imagined hierarchy. Harry Potter is a
good example. Removed from his distinguished wizard family and brought up by
ignorant muggles, he arrives at Hogwarts without any experience in magic. It
takes him seven books to gain a ɹrm command of his powers and knowledge of
his unique abilities.
Second, even if people belonging to diʃerent classes develop exactly the same
abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play
the game by diʃerent rules. If, in British-ruled India, an Untouchable, a Brahmin,
a Catholic Irishman and a Protestant Englishman had somehow developed exactly
the same business acumen, they still would not have had the same chance of
becoming rich. The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unoɽcial
glass ceilings.

The Vicious Circle

All societies are based on imagined hierarchies, but not necessarily on the same
hierarchies. What accounts for the diʃerences? Why did traditional Indian society
classify people according to caste, Ottoman society according to religion, and
American society according to race? In most cases the hierarchy originated as the
result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetuated and
refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it.
For instance, many scholars surmise that the Hindu caste system took shape
when Indo-Aryan people invaded the Indian subcontinent about 3,000 years ago,
subjugating the local population. The invaders established a stratiɹed society, in
which they – of course – occupied the leading positions (priests and warriors),
leaving the natives to live as servants and slaves. The invaders, who were few in
number, feared losing their privileged status and unique identity. To forestall this
danger, they divided the population into castes, each of which was required to
pursue a speciɹc occupation or perform a speciɹc role in society. Each had
diʃerent legal status, privileges and duties. Mixing of castes – social interaction,
marriage, even the sharing of meals – was prohibited. And the distinctions were
not just legal – they became an inherent part of religious mythology and practice.
The rulers argued that the caste system reɻected an eternal cosmic reality rather
than a chance historical development. Concepts of purity and impurity were
essential elements in Hindu religion, and they were harnessed to buttress the
social pyramid. Pious Hindus were taught that contact with members of a diʃerent
caste could pollute not only them personally, but society as a whole, and should
therefore be abhorred. Such ideas are hardly unique to Hindus. Throughout
history, and in almost all societies, concepts of pollution and purity have played a
leading role in enforcing social and political divisions and have been exploited by
numerous ruling classes to maintain their privileges. The fear of pollution is not a
complete fabrication of priests and princes, however. It probably has its roots in
biological survival mechanisms that make humans feel an instinctive revulsion
towards potential disease carriers, such as sick persons and dead bodies. If you
want to keep any human group isolated – women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks – the
best way to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of pollution.
The Hindu caste system and its attendant laws of purity became deeply
embedded in Indian culture. Long after the Indo-Aryan invasion was forgotten,
Indians continued to believe in the caste system and to abhor the pollution caused
by caste mixing. Castes were not immune to change. In fact, as time went by,
large castes were divided into sub-castes. Eventually the original four castes
turned into 3,000 diʃerent groupings called jati (literally ‘birth’). But this
proliferation of castes did not change the basic principle of the system, according

to which every person is born into a particular rank, and any infringement of its
rules pollutes the person and society as a whole. A persons jati determines her
profession, the food she can eat, her place of residence and her eligible marriage
partners. Usually a person can marry only within his or her caste, and the
resulting children inherit that status.
Whenever a new profession developed or a new group of people appeared on
the scene, they had to be recognised as a caste in order to receive a legitimate
place within Hindu society. Groups that failed to win recognition as a caste were,
literally, outcasts – in this stratiɹed society, they did not even occupy the lowest
rung. They became known as Untouchables. They had to live apart from all other
people and scrape together a living in humiliating and disgusting ways, such as
sifting through garbage dumps for scrap material. Even members of the lowest
caste avoided mingling with them, eating with them, touching them and certainly
marrying them. In modern India, matters of marriage and work are still heavily
inɻuenced by the caste system, despite all attempts by the democratic government
of India to break down such distinctions and convince Hindus that there is nothing
polluting in caste mixing.3

Purity in America

A similar vicious circle perpetuated the racial hierarchy in modern America. From
the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, the European conquerors imported
millions of African slaves to work the mines and plantations of America. They
chose to import slaves from Africa rather than from Europe or East Asia due to
three circumstantial factors. Firstly, Africa was closer, so it was cheaper to import
slaves from Senegal than from Vietnam.
Secondly, in Africa there already existed a well-developed slave trade (exporting
slaves mainly to the Middle East), whereas in Europe slavery was very rare. It was
obviously far easier to buy slaves in an existing market than to create a new one
from scratch.
Thirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as Virginia,
Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had originated
in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial genetic immunity
to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless and died in droves.
It was consequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in an
African slave than in a European slave or indentured labourer. Paradoxically,
genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority:
precisely because Africans were ɹtter in tropical climates than Europeans, they

ended up as the slaves of European masters! Due to these circumstantial factors,
the burgeoning new societies of America were to be divided into a ruling caste of
white Europeans and a subjugated caste of black Africans.
But people don’t like to say that they keep slaves of a certain race or origin
simply because it’s economically expedient. Like the Aryan conquerors of India,
white Europeans in the Americas wanted to be seen not only as economically
successful but also as pious, just and objective. Religious and scientiɹc myths were
pressed into service to justify this division. Theologians argued that Africans
descend from Ham, son of Noah, saddled by his father with a curse that his
oʃspring would be slaves. Biologists argued that blacks are less intelligent than
whites and their moral sense less developed. Doctors alleged that blacks live in
filth and spread diseases – in other words, they are a source of pollution.
These myths struck a chord in American culture, and in Western culture
generally. They continued to exert their inɻuence long after the conditions that
created slavery had disappeared. In the early nineteenth century imperial Britain
outlawed slavery and stopped the Atlantic slave trade, and in the decades that
followed slavery was gradually outlawed throughout the American continent.
Notably, this was the ɹrst and only time in history that slaveholding societies
voluntarily abolished slavery. But, even though the slaves were freed, the racist
myths that justiɹed slavery persisted. Separation of the races was maintained by
racist legislation and social custom.
The result was a self-reinforcing cycle of cause and eʃect, a vicious circle.
Consider, for example, the southern United States immediately after the Civil War.
In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution outlawed slavery and
the Fourteenth Amendment mandated that citizenship and the equal protection of
the law could not be denied on the basis of race. However, two centuries of
slavery meant that most black families were far poorer and far less educated than
most white families. A black person born in Alabama in 1865 thus had much less
chance of getting a good education and a well-paid job than did his white
neighbours. His children, born in the 1880S and 1890s, started life with the same
disadvantage – they, too, were born to an uneducated, poor family.
But economic disadvantage was not the whole story. Alabama was also home to
many poor whites who lacked the opportunities available to their better-oʃ racial
brothers and sisters. In addition, the Industrial Revolution and the waves of
immigration made the United States an extremely ɻuid society, where rags could
quickly turn into riches. If money was all that mattered, the sharp divide between
the races should soon have blurred, not least through intermarriage.
But that did not happen. By 1865 whites, as well as many blacks, took it to be a
simple matter of fact that blacks were less intelligent, more violent and sexually
dissolute, lazier and less concerned about personal cleanliness than whites. They

were thus the agents of violence, theft, rape and disease – in other words,
pollution. If a black Alabaman in 1895 miraculously managed to get a good
education and then applied for a respectable job such as a bank teller, his odds of
being accepted were far worse than those of an equally qualiɹed white candidate.
The stigma that labelled blacks as, by nature, unreliable, lazy and less intelligent
conspired against him.
You might think that people would gradually understand that these stigmas
were myth rather than fact and that blacks would be able, over time, to prove
themselves just as competent, law-abiding and clean as whites. In fact, the
opposite happened – these prejudices became more and more entrenched as time
went by. Since all the best jobs were held by whites, it became easier to believe
that blacks really are inferior. ‘Look,’ said the average white citizen, ‘blacks have
been free for generations, yet there are almost no black professors, lawyers,
doctors or even bank tellers. Isn’t that proof that blacks are simply less intelligent

and hard-working?’ Trapped in this vicious circle, blacks were not hired for white-
collar jobs because they were deemed unintelligent, and the proof of their

inferiority was the paucity of blacks in white-collar jobs.
The vicious circle did not stop there. As anti-black stigmas grew stronger, they
were translated into a system of ‘Jim Crow’ laws and norms that were meant to
safeguard the racial order. Blacks were forbidden to vote in elections, to study in
white schools, to buy in white stores, to eat in white restaurants, to sleep in white
hotels. The justiɹcation for all of this was that blacks were foul, slothful and
vicious, so whites had to be protected from them. Whites did not want to sleep in
the same hotel as blacks or to eat in the same restaurant, for fear of diseases. They
did not want their children learning in the same school as black children, for fear
of brutality and bad inɻuences. They did not want blacks voting in elections, since
blacks were ignorant and immoral. These fears were substantiated by scientiɹc
studies that ‘proved’ that blacks were indeed less educated, that various diseases
were more common among them, and that their crime rate was far higher (the
studies ignored the fact that these ‘facts’ resulted from discrimination against
blacks).
By the mid-twentieth century, segregation in the former Confederate states was
probably worse than in the late nineteenth century. Clennon King, a black student
who applied to the University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully committed to
a mental asylum. The presiding judge ruled that a black person must surely be
insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of Mississippi.

The vicious circle: a chance histotical situation is translated into a rigid social system.

Nothing was as revolting to American southerners (and many northerners) as
sexual relations and marriage between black men and white women. Sex between
the races became the greatest taboo and any violation, or suspected violation, was
viewed as deserving immediate and summary punishment in the form of lynching.
The Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist secret society, perpetrated many such
killings. They could have taught the Hindu Brahmins a thing or two about purity
laws.
With time, the racism spread to more and more cultural arenas. American
aesthetic culture was built around white standards of beauty. The physical
attributes of the white race – for example light skin, fair and straight hair, a small
upturned nose – came to be identiɹed as beautiful. Typical black features – dark
skin, dark and bushy hair, a ɻattened nose – were deemed ugly. These
preconceptions ingrained the imagined hierarchy at an even deeper level of
human consciousness.
Such vicious circles can go on for centuries and even millennia, perpetuating an
imagined hierarchy that sprang from a chance historical occurrence. Unjust
discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. Money comes to money,
and poverty to poverty. Education comes to education, and ignorance to
ignorance. Those once victimised by history are likely to be victimised yet again.
And those whom history has privileged are more likely to be privileged again.
Most sociopolitical hierarchies lack a logical or biological basis – they are
nothing but the perpetuation of chance events supported by myths. That is one
good reason to study history. If the division into blacks and whites or Brahmins
and Shudras was grounded in biological realities – that is, if Brahmins really had
better brains than Shudras – biology would be suɽcient for understanding human
society. Since the biological distinctions between diʃerent groups of Homo sapiens
are, in fact, negligible, biology can’t explain the intricacies of Indian society or

American racial dynamics. We can only understand those phenomena by studying
the events, circumstances, and power relations that transformed ɹgments of
imagination into cruel – and very real – social structures.

He and She

Diʃerent societies adopt diʃerent kinds of imagined hierarchies. Race is very
important to modern Americans but was relatively insigniɹcant to medieval
Muslims. Caste was a matter of life and death in medieval India, whereas in
modern Europe it is practically non-existent. One hierarchy, however, has been of
supreme importance in all known human societies: the hierarchy of gender.
People everywhere have divided themselves into men and women. And almost
everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the Agricultural
Revolution.
Some of the earliest Chinese texts are oracle bones, dating to 1200 BC, used to
divine the future. On one was engraved the question: ‘Will Lady Hao’s
childbearing be lucky?’ To which was written the reply: ‘If the child is born on a
ding day, lucky; if on a geng day, vastly auspicious.’ However, Lady Hao was to
give birth on a jiayin day. The text ends with the morose observation: ‘Three weeks
and one day later, on jiayin day, the child was born. Not lucky. It was a girl.’4
More than 3,000 years later, when Communist China enacted the ‘one child’
policy, many Chinese families continued to regard the birth of a girl as a
misfortune. Parents would occasionally abandon or murder newborn baby girls in
order to have another shot at getting a boy.
In many societies women were simply the property of men, most often their
fathers, husbands or brothers. Rape, in many legal systems, falls under property
violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was raped but the
male who owns her. This being the case, the legal remedy was the transfer of
ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the woman’s father or
brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property. The Bible decrees that ‘If a
man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and
they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the
young woman ɹfty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife’ (Deuteronomy
22:28–9). The ancient Hebrews considered this a reasonable arrangement.
Raping a woman who did not belong to any man was not considered a crime at
all, just as picking up a lost coin on a busy street is not considered theft. And if a
husband raped his own wife, he had committed no crime. In fact, the idea that a
husband could rape his wife was an oxymoron. To be a husband was to have full

control of your wife’s sexuality. To say that a husband ‘raped’ his wife was as
illogical as saying that a man stole his own wallet. Such thinking was not confined
to the ancient Middle East. As of 2006, there were still ɹfty-three countries where
a husband could not be prosecuted for the rape of his wife. Even in Germany, rape
laws were amended only in 1997 to create a legal category of marital rape.5
Is the division into men and women a product of the imagination, like the caste
system in India and the racial system in America, or is it a natural division with
deep biological roots? And if it is indeed a natural division, are there also
biological explanations for the preference given to men over women?
Some of the cultural, legal and political disparities between men and women
reɻect the obvious biological diʃerences between the sexes. Childbearing has
always been women’s job, because men don’t have wombs. Yet around this hard
universal kernel, every society accumulated layer upon layer of cultural ideas and
norms that have little to do with biology. Societies associate a host of attributes
with masculinity and femininity that, for the most part, lack a ɹrm biological
basis.
For instance, in democratic Athens of the ɹfth century BC, an individual
possessing a womb had no independent legal status and was forbidden to
participate in popular assemblies or to be a judge. With few exceptions, such an
individual could not beneɹt from a good education, nor engage in business or in
philosophical discourse. None of Athens’ political leaders, none of its great
philosophers, orators, artists or merchants had a womb. Does having a womb
make a person unɹt, biologically, for these professions? The ancient Athenians
thought so. Modern Athenians disagree. In present-day Athens, women vote, are
elected to public oɽce, make speeches, design everything from jewellery to
buildings to software, and go to university. Their wombs do not keep them from

doing any of these things as successfully as men do. True, they are still under-
represented in politics and business – only about 12 per cent of the members of

Greece’s parliament are women. But there is no legal barrier to their participation
in politics, and most modern Greeks think it is quite normal for a woman to serve
in public office.
Many modern Greeks also think that an integral part of being a man is being
sexually attracted to women only, and having sexual relations exclusively with the
opposite sex. They don’t see this as a cultural bias, but rather as a biological
reality – relations between two people of the opposite sex are natural, and
between two people of the same sex unnatural. In fact, though, Mother Nature
does not mind if men are sexually attracted to one another. It’s only human
mothers steeped in particular cultures who make a scene if their son has a ɻing
with the boy next door. The mother’s tantrums are not a biological imperative. A
signiɹcant number of human cultures have viewed homosexual relations as not

only legitimate but even socially constructive, ancient Greece being the most
notable example. The Iliad does not mention that Thetis had any objection to her
son Achilles’ relations with Patroclus. Queen Olympias of Macedon was one of the
most temperamental and forceful women of the ancient world, and even had her
own husband, King Philip, assassinated. Yet she didn’t have a ɹt when her son,
Alexander the Great, brought his lover Hephaestion home for dinner.
How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people
merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology
enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of
possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while
forbidding others. Biology enables women to have children – some cultures oblige
women to realise this possibility. Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one
another – some cultures forbid them to realise this possibility.
Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a
biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by deɹnition
also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of
nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever
bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of
light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other.
In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but
from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘in accordance
with the intentions of the God who created nature’. Christian theologians argued
that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a
particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by
God, then it is a natural activity. To use them diʃerently than God intends is
unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a
purpose, and the way they are used is in constant ɻux. There is not a single organ
in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it ɹrst appeared
hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function,
but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well. Mouths, for
example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to
take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we
also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand
grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors
600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?
Similarly, wings didn’t suddenly appear in all their aerodynamic glory. They
developed from organs that served another purpose. According to one theory,
insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body protrusions on ɻightless
bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than those without bumps, and
this enabled them to absorb more sunlight and thus stay warmer. In a slow

evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger. The same structure that was
good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of surface area, little weight – also,
by coincidence, gave the insects a bit of a lift when they skipped and jumped.
Those with bigger protrusions could skip and jump farther. Some insects started
using the things to glide, and from there it was a small step to wings that could
actually propel the bug through the air. Next time a mosquito buzzes in your ear,
accuse her of unnatural behaviour. If she were well behaved and content with
what God gave her, she’d use her wings only as solar panels.
The same sort of multitasking applies to our sexual organs and behaviour. Sex
ɹrst evolved for procreation and courtship rituals as a way of sizing up the ɹtness
of a potential mate. But many animals now put both to use for a multitude of
social purposes that have little to do with creating little copies of themselves.
Chimpanzees, for example, use sex to cement political alliances, establish intimacy
and defuse tensions. Is that unnatural?

Sex and Gender

There is little sense, then, in arguing that the natural function of women is to give
birth, or that homosexuality is unnatural. Most of the laws, norms, rights and
obligations that deɹne manhood and womanhood reɻect human imagination
more than biological reality.
Biologically, humans are divided into males and females. A male Homo sapiens
is one who has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome; a female is one with
two Xs. But ‘man’ and woman’ name social, not biological, categories. While in
the great majority of cases in most human societies men are males and women are
females, the social terms carry a lot of baggage that has only a tenuous, if any,
relationship to the biological terms. A man is not a Sapiens with particular
biological qualities such as XY chromosomes, testicles and lots of testosterone.
Rather, he ɹts into a particular slot in his society’s imagined human order. His
culture’s myths assign him particular masculine roles (like engaging in politics),
rights (like voting) and duties (like military service). Likewise, a woman is not a
Sapiens with two X chromosomes, a womb and plenty of oestrogen. Rather, she is
a female member of an imagined human order. The myths of her society assign
her unique feminine roles (raising children), rights (protection against violence)
and duties (obedience to her husband). Since myths, rather than biology, deɹne
the roles, rights and duties of men and women, the meaning of ‘manhood’ and
‘womanhood’ have varied immensely from one society to another.

22. Eighteenth-century masculinity: an official portrait of King Louis XIV of France. Note the long wig,
stockings, high-heeled shoes, dancers posture – and huge sword. In contemporary Europe, all these
(except for the sword) would be considered marks of effeminacy. But in his time Louis was a European

paragon of manhood and virility.

23. Twenty-first-century masculinity: an official portrait of Barack Obama. What happened to the wig,
stockings, high heels – and sword? Dominant men have never looked so dull and dreary as they do today.
During most of history, dominant men have been colourful and flamboyant, such as American Indian
chiefs with their feathered headdresses and Hindu maharajas decked out in silks and diamonds.
Throughout the animal kingdom males tend to be more colourful and accessorised than females – think

of peacocks’ tails and lions’ manes.

To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’, which
is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category. Sex is divided between
males and females, and the qualities of this division are objective and have
remained constant throughout history. Gender is divided between men and women
(and some cultures recognise other categories). So-called ‘masculine’ and
‘feminine’ qualities are inter-subjective and undergo constant changes. For

example, there are far-reaching diʃerences in the behaviour, desires, dress and
even body posture expected from women in classical Athens and women in
modern Athens.6
Sex is child’s play; but gender is serious business. To get to be a member of the
male sex is the simplest thing in the world. You just need to be born with an X and
a Y chromosome. To get to be a female is equally simple. A pair of X chromosomes
will do it. In contrast, becoming a man or a woman is a very complicated and
demanding undertaking. Since most masculine and feminine qualities are cultural
rather than biological, no society automatically crowns each male a man, or every
female a woman. Nor are these titles laurels that can be rested on once they are
acquired. Males must prove their masculinity constantly, throughout their lives,
from cradle to grave, in an endless series of rites and performances. And a
woman’s work is never done – she must continually convince herself and others
that she is feminine enough.
Success is not guaranteed. Males in particular live in constant dread of losing
their claim to manhood. Throughout history, males have been willing to risk and
even sacrifice their lives, just so that people will say ‘He’s a real man!’

What’s So Good About Men?

At least since the Agricultural Revolution, most human societies have been
patriarchal societies that valued men more highly than women. No matter how a
society deɹned ‘man’ and ‘woman’, to be a man was always better. Patriarchal
societies educate men to think and act in a masculine way and women to think
and act in a feminine way, punishing anyone who dares cross those boundaries.
Yet they do not equally reward those who conform. Qualities considered masculine
are more valued than those considered feminine, and members of a society who
personify the feminine ideal get less than those who exemplify the masculine
ideal. Fewer resources are invested in the health and education of women; they
have fewer economic opportunities, less political power, and less freedom of
movement. Gender is a race in which some of the runners compete only for the
bronze medal.
True, a handful of women have made it to the alpha position, such as Cleopatra
of Egypt, Empress Wu Zetian of China (c. AD 700) and Elizabeth I of England. Yet
they are the exceptions that prove the rule. Throughout Elizabeth’s forty-ɹve-year
reign, all Members of Parliament were men, all oɽcers in the Royal Navy and
army were men, all judges and lawyers were men, all bishops and archbishops
were men, all theologians and priests were men, all doctors and surgeons were

men, all students and professors in all universities and colleges were men, all
mayors and sheriʃs were men, and almost all the writers, architects, poets,
philosophers, painters, musicians and scientists were men.
Patriarchy has been the norm in almost all agricultural and industrial societies.
It has tenaciously weathered political upheavals, social revolutions and economic
transformations. Egypt, for example, was conquered numerous times over the
centuries. Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Arabs, Mameluks, Turks and
British occupied it – and its society always remained patriarchal. Egypt was
governed by pharaonic law, Greek law, Roman law, Muslim law, Ottoman law
and British law – and they all discriminated against people who were not ‘real
men’.
Since patriarchy is so universal, it cannot be the product of some vicious circle
that was kick-started by a chance occurrence. It is particularly noteworthy that
even before 1492, most societies in both America and Afro-Asia were patriarchal,
even though they had been out of contact for thousands of years. If patriarchy in
Afro-Asia resulted from some chance occurrence, why were the Aztecs and Incas
patriarchal? It is far more likely that even though the precise deɹnition of ‘man’
and ‘woman’ varies between cultures, there is some universal biological reason
why almost all cultures valued manhood over womanhood. We do not know what
this reason is. There are plenty of theories, none of them convincing.

Muscle Power

The most common theory points to the fact that men are stronger than women,
and that they have used their greater physical power to force women into
submission. A more subtle version of this claim argues that their strength allows
men to monopolise tasks that demand hard manual labour, such as ploughing and
harvesting. This gives them control of food production, which in turn translates
into political clout.
There are two problems with this emphasis on muscle power. First, the
statement that men are stronger than women’ is true only on average, and only
with regard to certain types of strength. Women are generally more resistant to
hunger, disease and fatigue than men. There are also many women who can run
faster and lift heavier weights than many men. Furthermore, and most
problematically for this theory, women have, throughout history, been excluded
mainly from jobs that require little physical eʃort (such as the priesthood, law and
politics), while engaging in hard manual labour in the ɹelds, in crafts and in the
household. If social power were divided in direct relation to physical strength or

stamina, women should have got far more of it.
Even more importantly, there simply is no direct relation between physical
strength and social power among humans. People in their sixties usually exercise
power over people in their twenties, even though twentysomethings are much

stronger than their elders. The typical plantation owner in Alabama in the mid-
nineteenth century could have been wrestled to the ground in seconds by any of

the slaves cultivating his cotton ɹelds. Boxing matches were not used to select
Egyptian pharaohs or Catholic popes. In forager societies, political dominance
generally resides with the person possessing the best social skills rather than the
most developed musculature. In organised crime, the big boss is not necessarily
the strongest man. He is often an older man who very rarely uses his own ɹsts; he
gets younger and ɹtter men to do the dirty jobs for him. A guy who thinks that the
way to take over the syndicate is to beat up the don is unlikely to live long
enough to learn from his mistake. Even among chimpanzees, the alpha male wins
his position by building a stable coalition with other males and females, not
through mindless violence.
In fact, human history shows that there is often an inverse relation between
physical prowess and social power. In most societies, it’s the lower classes who do
the manual labour. This may reɻect Homo sapiens position in the food chain. If all
that counted were raw physical abilities, Sapiens would have found themselves on
a middle rung of the ladder. But their mental and social skills placed them at the
top. It is therefore only natural that the chain of power within the species will also
be determined by mental and social abilities more than by brute force. It is
therefore hard to believe that the most inɻuential and most stable social hierarchy
in history is founded on men’s ability physically to coerce women.

The Scum of Society

Another theory explains that masculine dominance results not from strength but
from aggression. Millions of years of evolution have made men far more violent
than women. Women can match men as far as hatred, greed and abuse are
concerned, but when push comes to shove, the theory goes, men are more willing
to engage in raw physical violence. This is why throughout history warfare has
been a masculine prerogative.
In times of war, men’s control of the armed forces has made them the masters of
civilian society, too. They then used their control of civilian society to ɹght more
and more wars, and the greater the number of wars, the greater men’s control of
society. This feedback loop explains both the ubiquity of war and the ubiquity of

patriarchy.
Recent studies of the hormonal and cognitive systems of men and women
strengthen the assumption that men indeed have more aggressive and violent
tendencies, and are therefore, on average, better suited to serve as common
soldiers. Yet granted that the common soldiers are all men, does it follow that the
ones managing the war and enjoying its fruits must also be men? That makes no
sense. It’s like assuming that because all the slaves cultivating cotton ɹelds are
black, plantation owners will be black as well. Just as an all-black workforce
might be controlled by an all-white management, why couldn’t an all-male
soldiery be controlled by an all-female or at least partly female government? In
fact, in numerous societies throughout history, the top oɽcers did not work their
way up from the rank of private. Aristocrats, the wealthy and the educated were
automatically assigned officer rank and never served a day in the ranks.
When the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon’s nemesis, enlisted in the British army
at the age of eighteen, he was immediately commissioned as an oɽcer. He didn’t
think much of the plebeians under his command. ‘We have in the service the scum
of the earth as common soldiers,’ he wrote to a fellow aristocrat during the wars
against France. These common soldiers were usually recruited from among the
very poorest, or from ethnic minorities (such as the Irish Catholics). Their chances
of ascending the military ranks were negligible. The senior ranks were reserved
for dukes, princes and kings. But why only for dukes, and not for duchesses?
The French Empire in Africa was established and defended by the sweat and
blood of Senegalese, Algerians and working-class Frenchmen. The percentage of

well-born Frenchmen within the ranks was negligible. Yet the percentage of well-
born Frenchmen within the small elite that led the French army, ruled the empire

and enjoyed its fruits was very high. Why just Frenchmen, and not French
women?
In China there was a long tradition of subjugating the army to the civilian
bureaucracy, so mandarins who had never held a sword often ran the wars. ‘You
do not waste good iron to make nails,’ went a common Chinese saying, meaning
that really talented people join the civil bureaucracy, not the army. Why, then,
were all of these mandarins men?
One can’t reasonably argue that their physical weakness or low testosterone
levels prevented women from being successful mandarins, generals and
politicians. In order to manage a war, you surely need stamina, but not much
physical strength or aggressiveness. Wars are not a pub brawl. They are very
complex projects that require an extraordinary degree of organisation,
cooperation and appeasement. The ability to maintain peace at home, acquire
allies abroad, and understand what goes through the minds of other people
(particularly your enemies) is usually the key to victory. Hence an aggressive

brute is often the worst choice to run a war. Much better is a cooperative person
who knows how to appease, how to manipulate and how to see things from
diʃerent perspectives. This is the stuʃ empire-builders are made of. The militarily
incompetent Augustus succeeded in establishing a stable imperial regime,
achieving something that eluded both Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great, who
were much better generals. Both his admiring contemporaries and modern
historians often attribute this feat to his virtue of clementia – mildness and
clemency.
Women are often stereotyped as better manipulators and appeasers than men,
and are famed for their superior ability to see things from the perspective of
others. If there’s any truth in these stereotypes, then women should have made
excellent politicians and empire-builders, leaving the dirty work on the battlefields
to testosterone-charged but simple-minded machos. Popular myths
notwithstanding, this rarely happened in the real world. It is not at all clear why
not.

Patriarchal Genes

A third type of biological explanation gives less importance to brute force and
violence, and suggests that through millions of years of evolution, men and
women evolved diʃerent survival and reproduction strategies. As men competed
against each other for the opportunity to impregnate fertile women, an
individual’s chances of reproduction depended above all on his ability to
outperform and defeat other men. As time went by, the masculine genes that
made it to the next generation were those belonging to the most ambitious,
aggressive and competitive men.
A woman, on the other hand, had no problem ɹnding a man willing to
impregnate her. However, if she wanted her children to provide her with
grandchildren, she needed to carry them in her womb for nine arduous months,
and then nurture them for years. During that time she had fewer opportunities to
obtain food, and required a lot of help. She needed a man. In order to ensure her
own survival and the survival of her children, the woman had little choice but to
agree to whatever conditions the man stipulated so that he would stick around
and share some of the burden. As time went by, the feminine genes that made it to
the next generation belonged to women who were submissive caretakers. Women
who spent too much time ɹghting for power did not leave any of those powerful
genes for future generations.
The result of these diʃerent survival strategies – so the theory goes – is that men

have been programmed to be ambitious and competitive, and to excel in politics
and business, whereas women have tended to move out of the way and dedicate
their lives to raising children.
But this approach also seems to be belied by the empirical evidence. Particularly
problematic is the assumption that women’s dependence on external help made
them dependent on men, rather than on other women, and that male
competitiveness made men socially dominant. There are many species of animals,
such as elephants and bonobo chimpanzees, in which the dynamics between
dependent females and competitive males results in a matriarchal society. Since
females need external help, they are obliged to develop their social skills and
learn how to cooperate and appease. They construct all-female social networks
that help each member raise her children. Males, meanwhile, spend their time
ɹghting and competing. Their social skills and social bonds remain
underdeveloped. Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong networks
of cooperative females, while the self-centred and uncooperative males are pushed
to the sidelines. Though bonobo females are weaker on average than the males,
the females often gang up to beat males who overstep their limits.
If this is possible among bonobos and elephants, why not among Homo sapiens?
Sapiens are relatively weak animals, whose advantage rests in their ability to
cooperate in large numbers. If so, we should expect that dependent women, even
if they are dependent on men, would use their superior social skills to cooperate to
outmanoeuvre and manipulate aggressive, autonomous and self-centred men.
How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on
cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control
individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have
no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of
the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength,
aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a
greater tendency to cooperate. We just don’t know.
What we do know, however, is that during the last century gender roles have
undergone a tremendous revolution. More and more societies today not only give
men and women equal legal status, political rights and economic opportunities,
but also completely rethink their most basic conceptions of gender and sexuality.
Though the gender gap is still signiɹcant, events have been moving at a
breathtaking speed. At the beginning of the twentieth century the idea of giving
voting rights to women was generally seen in the USA as outrageous; the prospect
of a female cabinet secretary or Supreme Court justice was simply ridiculous;
whereas homosexuality was such a taboo subject that it could not even be openly
discussed. At the beginning of the twenty-ɹrst century women’s voting rights are
taken for granted; female cabinet secretaries are hardly a cause for comment; and

in 2013 ɹve US Supreme Court justices, three of them women, decided in favour of
legalising same-sex marriages (overruling the objections of four male justices).
These dramatic changes are precisely what makes the history of gender so
bewildering. If, as is being demonstrated today so clearly, the patriarchal system
has been based on unfounded myths rather than on biological facts, what accounts
for the universality and stability of this system?

The Arrow of History

AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION, human societies grew ever larger and
more complex, while the imagined constructs sustaining the social order also
became more elaborate. Myths and ɹctions accustomed people, nearly from the
moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain
standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby
created artiɹcial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate
effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called culture’.
During the ɹrst half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that every culture
was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging essence that deɹned it
for all time. Each human group had its own world view and system of social, legal
and political arrangements that ran as smoothly as the planets going around the
sun. In this view, cultures left to their own devices did not change. They just kept
going at the same pace and in the same direction. Only a force applied from
outside could change them. Anthropologists, historians and politicians thus
referred to ‘Samoan Culture’ or ‘Tasmanian Culture’ as if the same beliefs, norms
and values had characterised Samoans and Tasmanians from time immemorial.
Today, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is true. Every
culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant ɻux. The
culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through
interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures also undergo transitions due
to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely isolated culture existing in an
ecologically stable environment cannot avoid change. Unlike the laws of physics,
which are free of inconsistencies, every man-made order is packed with internal
contradictions. Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions,
and this process fuels change.
For instance, in medieval Europe the nobility believed in both Christianity and
chivalry. A typical nobleman went to church in the morning, and listened as the
priest held forth on the lives of the saints. ‘Vanity of vanities,’ said the priest, ‘all
is vanity. Riches, lust and honour are dangerous temptations. You must rise above
them, and follow in Christ’s footsteps. Be meek like Him, avoid violence and
extravagance, and if attacked – just turn the other cheek.’ Returning home in a

meek and pensive mood, the nobleman would change into his best silks and go to
a banquet in his lord’s castle. There the wine ɻowed like water, the minstrel sang
of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the guests exchanged dirty jokes and bloody war
tales. ‘It is better to die,’ declared the barons, ‘than to live with shame. If someone
questions your honour, only blood can wipe out the insult. And what is better in
life than to see your enemies flee before you, and their pretty daughters tremble at
your feet?’
The contradiction was never fully resolved. But as the European nobility, clergy
and commoners grappled with it, their culture changed. One attempt to ɹgure it
out produced the Crusades. On crusade, knights could demonstrate their military
prowess and their religious devotion at one stroke. The same contradiction
produced military orders such as the Templars and Hospitallers, who tried to mesh
Christian and chivalric ideals even more tightly. It was also responsible for a large
part of medieval art and literature, such as the tales of King Arthur and the Holy
Grail. What was Camelot but an attempt to prove that a good knight can and
should be a good Christian, and that good Christians make the best knights?
Another example is the modern political order. Ever since the French
Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality
and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each
other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are
better oʃ. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes
inevitably short-changes equality. The entire political history of the world since
1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.
Anyone who has read a novel by Charles Dickens knows that the liberal regimes
of nineteenth-century Europe gave priority to individual freedom even if it meant
throwing insolvent poor families in prison and giving orphans little choice but to
join schools for pickpockets. Anyone who has read a novel by Alexander
Solzhenitsyn knows how Communisms egalitarian ideal produced brutal tyrannies
that tried to control every aspect of daily life.
Contemporary American politics also revolve around this contradiction.
Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means raising taxes to fund
programmes to help the poor, elderly and inɹrm. But that infringes on the
freedom of individuals to spend their money as they wish. Why should the
government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put
my kids through college? Republicans, on the other hand, want to maximise
individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor
will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health care.
Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so
the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such
contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are

culture’s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just
as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music
forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think,
reevaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds.
If tensions, conɻicts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every culture, a
human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold contradictory beliefs
and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an essential feature of any culture
that it even has a name: cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is often
considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset. Had people
been unable to hold contradictory beliefs and values, it would probably have been
impossible to establish and maintain any human culture.
If, say, a Christian really wants to understand the Muslims who attend that
mosque down the street, he shouldn’t look for a pristine set of values that every
Muslim holds dear. Rather, he should enquire into the catch-22s of Muslim culture,
those places where rules are at war and standards scuʀe. It’s at the very spot
where the Muslims teeter between two imperatives that you’ll understand them
best.

The Spy Satellite

Human cultures are in constant ɻux. Is this ɻux completely random, or does it
have some overall pattern? In other words, does history have a direction?
The answer is yes. Over the millennia, small, simple cultures gradually coalesce
into bigger and more complex civilisations, so that the world contains fewer and
fewer mega-cultures, each of which is bigger and more complex. This is of course a
very crude generalisation, true only at the macro level. At the micro level, it seems

that for every group of cultures that coalesces into a mega-culture, there’s a mega-
culture that breaks up into pieces. The Mongol Empire expanded to dominate a

huge swathe of Asia and even parts of Europe, only to shatter into fragments.
Christianity converted hundreds of millions of people at the same time that it
splintered into innumerable sects. The Latin language spread through western and
central Europe, then split into local dialects that themselves eventually became
national languages. But these break-ups are temporary reversals in an inexorable
trend towards unity.
Perceiving the direction of history is really a question of vantage point. When
we adopt the proverbial bird’s-eye view of history, which examines developments
in terms of decades or centuries, it’s hard to say whether history moves in the
direction of unity or of diversity. However, to understand long-term processes the

bird’s-eye view is too myopic. We would do better to adopt instead the viewpoint
of a cosmic spy satellite, which scans millennia rather than centuries. From such a
vantage point it becomes crystal clear that history is moving relentlessly towards
unity. The sectioning of Christianity and the collapse of the Mongol Empire are
just speed bumps on history’s highway.
*

The best way to appreciate the general direction of history is to count the number
of separate human worlds that coexisted at any given moment on planet Earth.
Today, we are used to thinking about the whole planet as a single unit, but for
most of history, earth was in fact an entire galaxy of isolated human worlds.
Consider Tasmania, a medium-sized island south of Australia. It was cut off from
the Australian mainland in about 10,000 BC as the end of the Ice Age caused the
sea level to rise. A few thousand hunter-gatherers were left on the island, and had
no contact with any other humans until the arrival of the Europeans in the
nineteenth century. For 12,000 years, nobody else knew the Tasmanians were
there, and they didn’t know that there was anyone else in the world. They had
their wars, political struggles, social oscillations and cultural developments. Yet as
far as the emperors of China or the rulers of Mesopotamia were concerned,
Tasmania could just as well have been located on one of Jupiter’s moons. The
Tasmanians lived in a world of their own.
America and Europe, too, were separate worlds for most of their histories. In AD
378, the Roman emperor Valence was defeated and killed by the Goths at the
battle of Adrianople. In the same year, King Chak Tok Ich’aak of Tikal was
defeated and killed by the army of Teotihuacan. (Tikal was an important Mayan
city state, while Teotihuacan was then the largest city in America, with almost
250,000 inhabitants – of the same order of magnitude as its contemporary, Rome.)
There was absolutely no connection between the defeat of Rome and the rise of
Teotihuacan. Rome might just as well have been located on Mars, and
Teotihuacan on Venus.
How many diʃerent human worlds coexisted on earth? Around 10.000 BC our
planet contained many thousands of them. By 2000 BC, their numbers had
dwindled to the hundreds, or at most a few thousand. By AD 1450, their numbers
had declined even more drastically. At that time, just prior to the age of European
exploration, earth still contained a signiɹcant number of dwarf worlds such as
Tasmania. But close to 90 per cent of humans lived in a single mega-world: the
world of Afro-Asia. Most of Asia, most of Europe, and most of Africa (including
substantial chunks of sub-Saharan Africa) were already connected by signiɹcant

cultural, political and economic ties.
Most of the remaining tenth of the world’s human population was divided
between four worlds of considerable size and complexity:
1. The Mesoamerican World, which encompassed most of Central America and
parts of North America.
2. The Andean World, which encompassed most of western South America.
3. The Australian World, which encompassed the continent of Australia.

4. The Oceanic World, which encompassed most of the islands of the south-
western Pacific Ocean, from Hawaii to New Zealand.

Over the next 300 years, the Afro-Asian giant swallowed up all the other worlds. It
consumed the Mesoamerican World in 1521, when the Spanish conquered the
Aztec Empire. It took its ɹrst bite out of the Oceanic World at the same time,
during Ferdinand Magellan’s circumnavigation of the globe, and soon after that
completed its conquest. The Andean World collapsed in 1532, when Spanish
conquistadors crushed the Inca Empire. The ɹrst European landed on the
Australian continent in 1606, and that pristine world came to an end when British
colonisation began in earnest in 1788. Fifteen years later the Britons established
their ɹrst settlement in Tasmania, thus bringing the last autonomous human world
into the Afro-Asian sphere of influence.
It took the Afro-Asian giant several centuries to digest all that it had swallowed,
but the process was irreversible. Today almost all humans share the same
geopolitical system (the entire planet is divided into internationally recognised
states); the same economic system (capitalist market forces shape even the
remotest corners of the globe); the same legal system (human rights and
international law are valid everywhere, at least theoretically); and the same
scientiɹc system (experts in Iran, Israel, Australia and Argentina have exactly the
same views about the structure of atoms or the treatment of tuberculosis).
The single global culture is not homogeneous. Just as a single organic body
contains many diʃerent kinds of organs and cells, so our single global culture
contains many diʃerent types of lifestyles and people, from New York
stockbrokers to Afghan shepherds. Yet they are all closely connected and they
inɻuence one another in myriad ways. They still argue and ɹght, but they argue
using the same concepts and ɹght using the same weapons. A real ‘clash of
civilisations’ is like the proverbial dialogue of the deaf. Nobody can grasp what
the other is saying. Today when Iran and the United States rattle swords at one
another, they both speak the language of nation states, capitalist economies,
international rights and nuclear physics.

Map 3. Earth in AD 1450. The named locations within the Afro-Asian World were places visited by the
fourteenth-century Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta. A native of Tangier, in Morocco, Ibn Battuta visited
Timbuktu, Zanzibar, southern Russia, Central Asia, India, China and Indonesia. His travels illustrate the

unity of Afro-Asia on the eve of the modern era.

We still talk a lot about ‘authentic’ cultures, but if by authentic’ we mean
something that developed independently, and that consists of ancient local
traditions free of external inɻuences, then there are no authentic cultures left on
earth. Over the last few centuries, all cultures were changed almost beyond
recognition by a flood of global influences.
One of the most interesting examples of this globalisation is ‘ethnic’ cuisine. In
an Italian restaurant we expect to ɹnd spaghetti in tomato sauce; in Polish and
Irish restaurants lots of potatoes; in an Argentinian restaurant we can choose
between dozens of kinds of beefsteaks; in an Indian restaurant hot chillies are
incorporated into just about everything; and the highlight at any Swiss café is
thick hot chocolate under an alp of whipped cream. But none of these foods is
native to those nations. Tomatoes, chilli peppers and cocoa are all Mexican in
origin; they reached Europe and Asia only after the Spaniards conquered Mexico.
Julius Caesar and Dante Alighieri never twirled tomato-drenched spaghetti on
their forks (even forks hadn’t been invented yet), William Tell never tasted
chocolate, and Buddha never spiced up his food with chilli. Potatoes reached
Poland and Ireland no more than 400 years ago. The only steak you could obtain
in Argentina in 1492 was from a llama.
Hollywood ɹlms have perpetuated an image of the Plains Indians as brave
horsemen, courageously charging the wagons of European pioneers to protect the
customs of their ancestors. However, these Native American horsemen were not
the defenders of some ancient, authentic culture. Instead, they were the product of

a major military and political revolution that swept the plains of western North
America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a consequence of the arrival
of European horses. In 1492 there were no horses in America. The culture of the
nineteenth-century Sioux and Apache has many appealing features, but it was a
modern culture – a result of global forces – much more than authentic’.

The Global Vision

From a practical perspective, the most important stage in the process of global
uniɹcation occurred in the last few centuries, when empires grew and trade
intensiɹed. Ever-tightening links were formed between the people of Afro-Asia,
America, Australia and Oceania. Thus Mexican chilli peppers made it into Indian
food and Spanish cattle began grazing in Argentina. Yet from an ideological
perspective, an even more important development occurred during the ɹrst
millennium BC, when the idea of a universal order took root. For thousands of
years previously, history was already moving slowly in the direction of global
unity, but the idea of a universal order governing the entire world was still alien
to most people.

25. Sioux chiefs (1905). Neither the Sioux nor any other Great Plains tribe had horses prior to 1492.

Homo sapiens evolved to think of people as divided into us and them. ‘Us’ was
the group immediately around you, whoever you were, and ‘them’ was everyone

else. In fact, no social animal is ever guided by the interests of the entire species
to which it belongs. No chimpanzee cares about the interests of the chimpanzee
species, no snail will lift a tentacle for the global snail community, no lion alpha
male makes a bid for becoming the king of all lions, and at the entrance of no
beehive can one find the slogan: ‘Worker bees of the world – unite!’
But beginning with the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens became more and
more exceptional in this respect. People began to cooperate on a regular basis
with complete strangers, whom they imagined as ‘brothers’ or ‘friends’. Yet this
brotherhood was not universal. Somewhere in the next valley, or beyond the
mountain range, one could still sense ‘them’. When the ɹrst pharaoh, Menes,
united Egypt around 3000 BC, it was clear to the Egyptians that Egypt had a
border, and beyond the border lurked ‘barbarians’. The barbarians were alien,
threatening, and interesting only to the extent that they had land or natural
resources that the Egyptians wanted. All the imagined orders people created
tended to ignore a substantial part of humankind.
The ɹrst millennium BC witnessed the appearance of three potentially universal
orders, whose devotees could for the ɹrst time imagine the entire world and the
entire human race as a single unit governed by a single set of laws. Everyone was
‘us’, at least potentially. There was no longer ‘them’. The ɹrst universal order to
appear was economic: the monetary order. The second universal order was
political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of
universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.
Merchants, conquerors and prophets were the ɹrst people who managed to
transcend the binary evolutionary division, ‘us vs them’, and to foresee the
potential unity of humankind. For the merchants, the entire world was a single
market and all humans were potential customers. They tried to establish an
economic order that would apply to all, everywhere. For the conquerors, the
entire world was a single empire and all humans were potential subjects, and for
the prophets, the entire world held a single truth and all humans were potential
believers. They too tried to establish an order that would be applicable for
everyone everywhere.
During the last three millennia, people made more and more ambitious attempts
to realise that global vision. The next three chapters discuss how money, empires
and universal religions spread, and how they laid the foundation of the united
world of today. We begin with the story of the greatest conqueror in history, a
conqueror possessed of extreme tolerance and adaptability, thereby turning
people into ardent disciples. This conqueror is money. People who do not believe
in the same god or obey the same king are more than willing to use the same
money. Osama Bin Laden, for all his hatred of American culture, American
religion and American politics, was very fond of American dollars. How did

money succeed where gods and kings failed?

The Scent of Money

IN 1519 HERNÁN CORTÉS AND HIS CONQUISTADORS invaded Mexico, hitherto
an isolated human world. The Aztecs, as the people who lived there called
themselves, quickly noticed that the aliens showed an extraordinary interest in a
certain yellow metal. In fact, they never seemed to stop talking about it. The
natives were not unfamiliar with gold – it was pretty and easy to work, so they
used it to make jewellery and statues, and they occasionally used gold dust as a
medium of exchange. But when an Aztec wanted to buy something, he generally
paid in cocoa beans or bolts of cloth. The Spanish obsession with gold thus seemed
inexplicable. What was so important about a metal that could not be eaten, drunk
or woven, and was too soft to use for tools or weapons? When the natives
questioned Cortés as to why the Spaniards had such a passion for gold, the
conquistador answered, ‘Because I and my companions suffer from a disease of the
heart which can be cured only with gold.’1
In the Afro-Asian world from which the Spaniards came, the obsession for gold
was indeed an epidemic. Even the bitterest of enemies lusted after the same
useless yellow metal. Three centuries before the conquest of Mexico, the ancestors
of Cortés and his army waged a bloody war of religion against the Muslim
kingdoms in Iberia and North Africa. The followers of Christ and the followers of
Allah killed each other by the thousands, devastated ɹelds and orchards, and
turned prosperous cities into smouldering ruins – all for the greater glory of Christ
or Allah.
As the Christians gradually gained the upper hand, they marked their victories
not only by destroying mosques and building churches,but also by issuing new
gold and silver coins bearing the sign of the cross and thanking God for His help
in combating the inɹdels. Yet alongside the new currency, the victors minted
another type of coin, called the millares, which carried a somewhat diʃerent
message. These square coins made by the Christian conquerors were emblazoned
with ɻowing Arabic script that declared: ‘There is no god except Allah, and
Muhammad is Allah’s messenger.’ Even the Catholic bishops of Melgueil and Agde
issued these faithful copies of popular Muslim coins, and God-fearing Christians
happily used them.2

Tolerance ɻourished on the other side of the hill too. Muslim merchants in North
Africa conducted business using Christian coins such as the Florentine ɻorin, the
Venetian ducat and the Neapolitan gigliato. Even Muslim rulers who called for
jihad against the inɹdel Christians were glad to receive taxes in coins that invoked
Christ and His Virgin Mother.3

How Much is It?

Hunter-gatherers had no money. Each band hunted, gathered and manufactured
almost everything it required, from meat to medicine, from sandals to sorcery.
Diʃerent band members may have specialised in diʃerent tasks, but they shared
their goods and services through an economy of favours and obligations. A piece
of meat given for free would carry with it the assumption of reciprocity – say, free
medical assistance. The band was economically independent; only a few rare
items that could not be found locally – seashells, pigments, obsidian and the like –
had to be obtained from strangers. This could usually be done by simple barter:
‘We’ll give you pretty seashells, and you’ll give us high-quality flint.’
Little of this changed with the onset of the Agricultural Revolution. Most people
continued to live in small, intimate communities. Much like a hunter-gatherer
band, each village was a self-suɽcient economic unit, maintained by mutual
favours and obligations plus a little barter with outsiders. One villager may have
been particularly adept at making shoes, another at dispensing medical care, so
villagers knew where to turn when barefoot or sick. But villages were small and
their economies limited, so there could be no full-time shoemakers and doctors.
The rise of cities and kingdoms and the improvement in transport infrastructure
brought about new opportunities for specialisation. Densely populated cities
provided full-time employment not just for professional shoemakers and doctors,
but also for carpenters, priests, soldiers and lawyers. Villages that gained a
reputation for producing really good wine, olive oil or ceramics discovered that it
was worth their while to specialise nearly exclusively in that product and trade it
with other settlements for all the other goods they needed. This made a lot of
sense. Climates and soils differ, so why drink mediocre wine from your backyard if
you can buy a smoother variety from a place whose soil and climate is much
better suited to grape vines? If the clay in your backyard makes stronger and
prettier pots, then you can make an exchange. Furthermore, full-time specialist
vintners and potters, not to mention doctors and lawyers, can hone their expertise
to the beneɹt of all. But specialisation created a problem – how do you manage
the exchange of goods between the specialists?

An economy of favours and obligations doesn’t work when large numbers of
strangers try to cooperate. It’s one thing to provide free assistance to a sister or a
neighbour, a very diʃerent thing to take care of foreigners who might never
reciprocate the favour. One can fall back on barter. But barter is eʃective only
when exchanging a limited range of products. It cannot form the basis for a
complex economy.4
In order to understand the limitations of barter, imagine that you own an apple
orchard in the hill country that produces the crispest, sweetest apples in the entire
province. You work so hard in your orchard that your shoes wear out. So you
harness up your donkey cart and head to the market town down by the river. Your
neighbour told you that a shoemaker on the south end of the marketplace made
him a really sturdy pair of boots that’s lasted him through ɹve seasons. You ɹnd
the shoemaker’s shop and oʃer to barter some of your apples in exchange for the
shoes you need.
The shoemaker hesitates. How many apples should he ask for in payment?
Every day he encounters dozens of customers, a few of whom bring along sacks of
apples, while others carry wheat, goats or cloth – all of varying quality. Still
others oʃer their expertise in petitioning the king or curing backaches. The last
time the shoemaker exchanged shoes for apples was three months ago, and back
then he asked for three sacks of apples. Or was it four? But come to think of it,
those apples were sour valley apples, rather than prime hill apples. On the other
hand, on that previous occasion, the apples were given in exchange for small
women’s shoes. This fellow is asking for man-size boots. Besides, in recent weeks a
disease has decimated the ɻocks around town, and skins are becoming scarce. The
tanners are starting to demand twice as many ɹnished shoes in exchange for the
same quantity of leather. Shouldn’t that be taken into consideration?
In a barter economy, every day the shoemaker and the apple grower will have
to learn anew the relative prices of dozens of commodities. If one hundred
diʃerent commodities are traded in the market, then buyers and sellers will have
to know 4,950 diʃerent exchange rates. And if 1,000 diʃerent commodities are
traded, buyers and sellers must juggle 499,500 diʃerent exchange rates!5 How do
you figure it out?
It gets worse. Even if you manage to calculate how many apples equal one pair
of shoes, barter is not always possible. After all, a trade requires that each side
want what the other has to oʃer. What happens if the shoemaker doesn’t like
apples and, if at the moment in question, what he really wants is a divorce? True,
the farmer could look for a lawyer who likes apples and set up a three-way deal.
But what if the lawyer is full up on apples but really needs a haircut?
Some societies tried to solve the problem by establishing a central barter system
that collected products from specialist growers and manufacturers and distributed

them to those who needed them. The largest and most famous such experiment
was conducted in the Soviet Union, and it failed miserably. ‘Everyone would work
according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs’ turned out in
practice into ‘everyone would work as little as they can get away with, and
receive as much as they could grab’. More moderate and more successful
experiments were made on other occasions, for example in the Inca Empire. Yet
most societies found a more easy way to connect large numbers of experts – they
developed money.

Shells and Cigarettes

Money was created many times in many places. Its development required no
technological breakthroughs – it was a purely mental revolution. It involved the
creation of a new inter-subjective reality that exists solely in people’s shared
imagination.
Money is not coins and banknotes. Money is anything that people are willing to
use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose
of exchanging goods and services. Money enables people to compare quickly and
easily the value of diʃerent commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to
easily exchange one thing for another, and to store wealth conveniently. There
have been many types of money. The most familiar is the coin, which is a
standardised piece of imprinted metal. Yet money existed long before the
invention of coinage, and cultures have prospered using other things as currency,
such as shells, cattle, skins, salt, grain, beads, cloth and promissory notes. Cowry
shells were used as money for about 4,000 years all over Africa, South Asia, East
Asia and Oceania. Taxes could still be paid in cowry shells in British Uganda in
the early twentieth century.

26. In ancient Chinese script the cowry-shell sign represented money, in words such as ‘to sell’ or

‘reward’.

In modern prisons and POW camps, cigarettes have often served as money.
Even non-smoking prisoners have been willing to accept cigarettes in payment,
and to calculate the value of all other goods and services in cigarettes. One
Auschwitz survivor described the cigarette currency used in the camp: ‘We had our
own currency, whose value no one questioned: the cigarette. The price of every
article was stated in cigarettes ... In “normal” times, that is, when the candidates
to the gas chambers were coming in at a regular pace, a loaf of bread cost twelve
cigarettes; a 300-gram package of margarine, thirty; a watch, eighty to 200; a litre
of alcohol, 400 cigarettes!’6
In fact, even today coins and banknotes are a rare form of money. In 2006, the
sum total of money in the world is about $60 trillion, yet the sum total of coins
and banknotes was less than $6 trillion.7 More than 90 per cent of all money –
more than $50 trillion appearing in our accounts – exists only on computer
servers. Accordingly, most business transactions are executed by moving electronic
data from one computer ɹle to another, without any exchange of physical cash.

Only a criminal buys a house, for example, by handing over a suitcase full of
banknotes. As long as people are willing to trade goods and services in exchange
for electronic data, it’s even better than shiny coins and crisp banknotes – lighter,
less bulky, and easier to keep track of.
For complex commercial systems to function, some kind of money is
indispensable. A shoemaker in a money economy needs to know only the prices
charged for various kinds of shoes – there is no need to memorise the exchange
rates between shoes and apples or goats. Money also frees apple experts from the
need to search out apple-craving shoemakers, because everyone always wants
money. This is perhaps its most basic quality. Everyone always wants money
because everyone else also always wants money, which means you can exchange
money for whatever you want or need. The shoemaker will always be happy to
take your money, because no matter what he really wants – apples, goats or a
divorce – he can get it in exchange for money.
Money is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to convert
almost everything into almost anything else. Brawn gets converted to brain when
a discharged soldier ɹnances his college tuition with his military beneɹts. Land
gets converted into loyalty when a baron sells property to support his retainers.
Health is converted to justice when a physician uses her fees to hire a lawyer – or
bribe a judge. It is even possible to convert sex into salvation, as ɹfteenth-century
prostitutes did when they slept with men for money, which they in turn used to
buy indulgences from the Catholic Church.
Ideal types of money enable people not merely to turn one thing into another,
but to store wealth as well. Many valuables cannot be stored – such as time or
beauty. Some things can be stored only for a short time, such as strawberries.
Other things are more durable, but take up a lot of space and require expensive
facilities and care. Grain, for example, can be stored for years, but to do so you
need to build huge storehouses and guard against rats, mould, water, ɹre and
thieves. Money, whether paper, computer bits or cowry shells, solves these
problems. Cowry shells don’t rot, are unpalatable to rats, can survive ɹres and are
compact enough to be locked up in a safe.
In order to use wealth it is not enough just to store it. It often needs to be
transported from place to place. Some forms of wealth, such as real estate, cannot
be transported at all. Commodities such as wheat and rice can be transported only
with diɽculty. Imagine a wealthy farmer living in a moneyless land who
emigrates to a distant province. His wealth consists mainly of his house and rice
paddies. The farmer cannot take with him the house or the paddies. He might
exchange them for tons of rice, but it would be very burdensome and expensive to
transport all that rice. Money solves these problems. The farmer can sell his
property in exchange for a sack of cowry shells, which he can easily carry

wherever he goes.
Because money can convert, store and transport wealth easily and cheaply, it
made a vital contribution to the appearance of complex commercial networks and
dynamic markets. Without money, commercial networks and markets would have
been doomed to remain very limited in their size, complexity and dynamism.

How Does Money Work?

Cowry shells and dollars have value only in our common imagination. Their worth
is not inherent in the chemical structure of the shells and paper, or their colour, or
their shape. In other words, money isn’t a material reality – it is a psychological
construct. It works by converting matter into mind. But why does it succeed? Why
should anyone be willing to exchange a fertile rice paddy for a handful of useless
cowry shells? Why are you willing to ɻip hamburgers, sell health insurance or
babysit three obnoxious brats when all you get for your exertions is a few pieces
of coloured paper?
People are willing to do such things when they trust the ɹgments of their
collective imagination. Trust is the raw material from which all types of money
are minted. When a wealthy farmer sold his possessions for a sack of cowry shells
and travelled with them to another province, he trusted that upon reaching his
destination other people would be willing to sell him rice, houses and ɹelds in
exchange for the shells. Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not
just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system
of mutual trust ever devised.
What created this trust was a very complex and long-term network of political,
social and economic relations. Why do I believe in the cowry shell or gold coin or
dollar bill? Because my neighbours believe in them. And my neighbours believe in
them because I believe in them. And we all believe in them because our king
believes in them and demands them in taxes, and because our priest believes in
them and demands them in tithes. Take a dollar bill and look at it carefully. You
will see that it is simply a colourful piece of paper with the signature of the US
secretary of the treasury on one side, and the slogan ‘In God We Trust’ on the
other. We accept the dollar in payment, because we trust in God and the US
secretary of the treasury. The crucial role of trust explains why our ɹnancial
systems are so tightly bound up with our political, social and ideological systems,
why ɹnancial crises are often triggered by political developments, and why the
stock market can rise or fall depending on the way traders feel on a particular
morning.

Initially, when the ɹrst versions of money were created, people didn’t have this
sort of trust, so it was necessary to deɹne as ‘money’ things that had real intrinsic
value. History’s first known money Sumerian barley money – is a good example. It
appeared in Sumer around 3000 BC, at the same time and place, and under the
same circumstances, in which writing appeared. Just as writing developed to
answer the needs of intensifying administrative activities, so barley money
developed to answer the needs of intensifying economic activities.
Barley money was simply barley – ɹxed amounts of barley grains used as a
universal measure for evaluating and exchanging all other goods and services. The
most common measurement was the sila, equivalent to roughly one litre.
Standardised bowls, each capable of containing one sila, were mass-produced so
that whenever people needed to buy or sell anything, it was easy to measure the
necessary amounts of barley. Salaries, too, were set and paid in silas of barley. A
male labourer earned sixty silas a month, a female labourer thirty silas. A foreman
could earn between 1,200 and 5,000 silas. Not even the most ravenous foreman
could eat 5,000 litres of barley a month, but he could use the silas he didn’t eat to
buy all sorts of other commodities – oil, goats, slaves, and something else to eat
besides barley.8
Even though barley has intrinsic value, it was not easy to convince people to
use it as money rather than as just another commodity. In order to understand
why, just think what would happen if you took a sack full of barley to your local
shopping centre, and tried to buy a shirt or a pizza. The vendors would probably
call security. Still, it was somewhat easier to build trust in barley as the ɹrst type
of money, because barley has an inherent biological value. Humans can eat it. On
the other hand, it was diɽcult to store and transport barley. The real
breakthrough in monetary history occurred when people gained trust in money
that lacked inherent value, but was easier to store and transport. Such money
appeared in ancient Mesopotamia in the middle of the third millennium BC. This
was the silver shekel.
The silver shekel was not a coin, but rather 8.33 grams of silver. When
Hammurabi’s Code declared that a superior man who killed a slave woman must
pay her owner twenty silver shekels, it meant that he had to pay 166 grams of
silver, not twenty coins. Most monetary terms in the Old Testament are given in
terms of silver rather than coins. Josephs brothers sold him to the Ishmaelites for
twenty silver shekels, or rather 166 grams of silver (the same price as a slave
woman – he was a youth, after all).
Unlike the barley sila, the silver shekel had no inherent value. You cannot eat,
drink or clothe yourself in silver, and it’s too soft for making useful tools –
ploughshares or swords of silver would crumple almost as fast as ones made out of
aluminium foil. When they are used for anything, silver and gold are made into

jewellery, crowns and other status symbols – luxury goods that members of a
particular culture identify with high social status. Their value is purely cultural.

Set weights of precious metals eventually gave birth to coins. The ɹrst coins in
history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia.
These coins had a standardised weight of gold or silver, and were imprinted with
an identiɹcation mark. The mark testiɹed to two things. First, it indicated how
much precious metal the coin contained. Second, it identiɹed the authority that
issued the coin and that guaranteed its contents. Almost all coins in use today are
descendants of the Lydian coins.
Coins had two important advantages over unmarked metal ingots. First, the
latter had to be weighed for every transaction. Second, weighing the ingot is not
enough. How does the shoemaker know that the silver ingot I put down for my
boots is really made of pure silver, and not of lead covered on the outside by a
thin silver coating? Coins help solve these problems. The mark imprinted on them
testiɹes to their exact value, so the shoemaker doesn’t have to keep a scale on his
cash register. More importantly, the mark on the coin is the signature of some
political authority that guarantees the coin’s value.
The shape and size of the mark varied tremendously throughout history, but the
message was always the same: ‘I, the Great King So-And-So, give you my personal
word that this metal disc contains exactly ɹve grams of gold. If anyone dares
counterfeit this coin, it means he is fabricating my own signature, which would be
a blot on my reputation. I will punish such a crime with the utmost severity.’
That’s why counterfeiting money has always been considered a much more serious
crime than other acts of deception. Counterfeiting is not just cheating – it’s a
breach of sovereignty, an act of subversion against the power, privileges and
person of the king. The legal term is lese-majesty (violating majesty), and was
typically punished by torture and death. As long as people trusted the power and
integrity of the king, they trusted his coins. Total strangers could easily agree on
the worth of a Roman denarius coin, because they trusted the power and integrity
of the Roman emperor, whose name and picture adorned it.

27. One of the earliest coins in history, from Lydia of the seventh century BC.

In turn, the power of the emperor rested on the denarius. Just think how
diɽcult it would have been to maintain the Roman Empire without coins – if the
emperor had to raise taxes and pay salaries in barley and wheat. It would have
been impossible to collect barley taxes in Syria, transport the funds to the central
treasury in Rome, and transport them again to Britain in order to pay the legions
there. It would have been equally diɽcult to maintain the empire if the
inhabitants of the city of Rome believed in gold coins, but the subject populations
rejected this belief, putting their trust instead in cowry shells, ivory beads or rolls
of cloth.

The Gospel of Gold

The trust in Rome’s coins was so strong that even outside the empire’s borders,
people were happy to receive payment in denarii. In the ɹrst century AD, Roman
coins were an accepted medium of exchange in the markets of India, even though
the closest Roman legion was thousands of kilometres away. The Indians had such
a strong conɹdence in the denarius and the image of the emperor that when local
rulers struck coins of their own they closely imitated the denarius, down to the
portrait of the Roman emperor! The name ‘denarius’ became a generic name for
coins. Muslim caliphs Arabicised this name and issued ‘dinars’. The dinar is still
the oɽcial name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and
several other countries.
As Lydian-style coinage was spreading from the Mediterranean to the Indian
Ocean, China developed a slightly diʃerent monetary system, based on bronze
coins and unmarked silver and gold ingots. Yet the two monetary systems had
enough in common (especially the reliance on gold and silver) that close
monetary and commercial relations were established between the Chinese zone
and the Lydian zone. Muslim and European merchants and conquerors gradually
spread the Lydian system and the gospel of gold to the far corners of the earth. By
the late modern era the entire world was a single monetary zone, relying ɹrst on
gold and silver, and later on a few trusted currencies such as the British pound and
the American dollar.
The appearance of a single transnational and transcultural monetary zone laid
the foundation for the uniɹcation of Afro-Asia, and eventually of the entire globe,
into a single economic and political sphere. People continued to speak mutually
incomprehensible languages, obey diʃerent rulers and worship distinct gods, but

all believed in gold and silver and in gold and silver coins. Without this shared
belief, global trading networks would have been virtually impossible. The gold
and silver that sixteenth-century conquistadors found in America enabled
European merchants to buy silk, porcelain and spices in East Asia, thereby moving
the wheels of economic growth in both Europe and East Asia. Most of the gold and
silver mined in Mexico and the Andes slipped through European ɹngers to ɹnd a
welcome home in the purses of Chinese silk and porcelain manufacturers. What
would have happened to the global economy if the Chinese hadn’t suʃered from
the same ‘disease of the heart’ that aʀicted Cortés and his companions – and had
refused to accept payment in gold and silver?
Yet why should Chinese, Indians, Muslims and Spaniards – who belonged to
very diʃerent cultures that failed to agree about much of anything – nevertheless
share the belief in gold? Why didn’t it happen that Spaniards believed in gold,
while Muslims believed in barley, Indians in cowry shells, and Chinese in rolls of
silk? Economists have a ready answer. Once trade connects two areas, the forces
of supply and demand tend to equalise the prices of transportable goods. In order
to understand why, consider a hypothetical case. Assume that when regular trade
opened between India and the Mediterranean, Indians were uninterested in gold,
so it was almost worthless. But in the Mediterranean, gold was a coveted status
symbol, hence its value was high. What would happen next?
Merchants travelling between India and the Mediterranean would notice the
diʃerence in the value of gold. In order to make a proɹt, they would buy gold
cheaply in India and sell it dearly in the Mediterranean. Consequently, the
demand for gold in India would skyrocket, as would its value. At the same time
the Mediterranean would experience an inɻux of gold, whose value would
consequently drop. Within a short time the value of gold in India and the
Mediterranean would be quite similar. The mere fact that Mediterranean people
believed in gold would cause Indians to start believing in it as well. Even if
Indians still had no real use for gold, the fact that Mediterranean people wanted it
would be enough to make the Indians value it.
Similarly, the fact that another person believes in cowry shells, or dollars, or
electronic data, is enough to strengthen our own belief in them, even if that
person is otherwise hated, despised or ridiculed by us. Christians and Muslims who
could not agree on religious beliefs could nevertheless agree on a monetary belief,
because whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe
that other people believe in something.
For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched
money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the
apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state
laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust

system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does
not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation.
Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each
other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.

The Price of Money

Money is based on two universal principles:
a. Universal convertibility: with money as an alchemist, you can turn land into
loyalty, justice into health, and violence into knowledge.
b. Universal trust: with money as a go-between, any two people can cooperate
on any project.
These principles have enabled millions of strangers to cooperate eʃectively in
trade and industry. But these seemingly benign principles have a dark side. When
everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry
shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing
them with the cold laws of supply and demand.
Human communities and families have always been based on belief in ‘priceless’
things, such as honour, loyalty, morality and love. These things lie outside the
domain of the market, and they shouldn’t be bought or sold for money. Even if the
market oʃers a good price, certain things just aren’t done. Parents mustn’t sell
their children into slavery; a devout Christian must not commit a mortal sin; a
loyal knight must never betray his lord; and ancestral tribal lands shall never be
sold to foreigners.
Money has always tried to break through these barriers, like water seeping
through cracks in a dam. Parents have been reduced to selling some of their
children into slavery in order to buy food for the others. Devout Christians have
murdered, stolen and cheated – and later used their spoils to buy forgiveness from
the church. Ambitious knights auctioned their allegiance to the highest bidder,
while securing the loyalty of their own followers by cash payments. Tribal lands
were sold to foreigners from the other side of the world in order to purchase an
entry ticket into the global economy.
Money has an even darker side. For although money builds universal trust
between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred
values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not
trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour – we trust the coin they hold. If they
run out of coins, we run out of trust. As money brings down the dams of
community, religion and state, the world is in danger of becoming one big and

rather heartless marketplace.
Hence the economic history of humankind is a delicate dance. People rely on
money to facilitate cooperation with strangers, but they’re afraid it will corrupt
human values and intimate relations. With one hand people willingly destroy the
communal dams that held at bay the movement of money and commerce for so
long. Yet with the other hand they build new dams to protect society, religion and
the environment from enslavement to market forces.
It is common nowadays to believe that the market always prevails, and that the
dams erected by kings, priests and communities cannot long hold back the tides of
money. This is naïve. Brutal warriors, religious fanatics and concerned citizens
have repeatedly managed to trounce calculating merchants, and even to reshape
the economy. It is therefore impossible to understand the uniɹcation of
humankind as a purely economic process. In order to understand how thousands
of isolated cultures coalesced over time to form the global village of today, we
must take into account the role of gold and silver, but we cannot disregard the
equally crucial role of steel.

Imperial Visions

THE ANCIENT ROMANS WERE USED TO being defeated. Like the rulers of most of
history’s great empires, they could lose battle after battle but still win the war. An
empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire.
Yet even the Romans found it hard to stomach the news arriving from northern
Iberia in the middle of the second century BC. A small, insigniɹcant mountain town
called Numantia, inhabited by the peninsula’s native Celts, had dared to throw oʃ
the Roman yoke. Rome at the time was the unquestioned master of the entire
Mediterranean basin, having vanquished the Macedonian and Seleucid empires,
subjugated the proud city states of Greece, and turned Carthage into a
smouldering ruin. The Numantians had nothing on their side but their ɹerce love
of freedom and their inhospitable terrain. Yet they forced legion after legion to
surrender or retreat in shame.
Eventually, in 134 BC, Roman patience snapped. The Senate decided to send
Scipio Aemilianus, Rome’s foremost general and the man who had levelled
Carthage, to take care of the Numantians. He was given a massive army of more
than 30,000 soldiers. Scipio, who respected the ɹghting spirit and martial skill of
the Numantians, preferred not to waste his soldiers in unnecessary combat.
Instead, he encircled Numantia with a line of fortiɹcations, blocking the town’s
contact with the outside world. Hunger did his work for him. After more than a
year, the food supply ran out. When the Numantians realised that all hope was
lost, they burned down their town; according to Roman accounts, most of them
killed themselves so as not to become Roman slaves.
Numantia later became a symbol of Spanish independence and courage. Miguel
de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote, wrote a tragedy called The Siege of
Numantia which ends with the town’s destruction, but also with a vision of Spain’s
future greatness. Poets composed paeans to its ɹerce defenders and painters
committed majestic depictions of the siege to canvas. In 1882, its ruins were
declared a national monument’ and became a pilgrimage site for Spanish patriots.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the most popular comic books in Spain weren’t about
Superman and Spiderman – they told of the adventures of El Jabato, an imaginary
ancient Iberian hero who fought against the Roman oppressors. The ancient

Numantians are to this day Spain’s paragons of heroism and patriotism, cast as
role models for the country’s young people.
Yet Spanish patriots extol the Numantians in Spanish – a romance language that
is a progeny of Scipio’s Latin. The Numantians spoke a now dead and lost Celtic
language. Cervantes wrote The Siege of Numantia in Latin script, and the play
follows Graeco-Roman artistic models. Numantia had no theatres. Spanish patriots
who admire Numantian heroism tend also to be loyal followers of the Roman
Catholic Church – don’t miss that ɹrst word – a church whose leader still sits in
Rome and whose God prefers to be addressed in Latin. Similarly, modern Spanish
law derives from Roman law; Spanish politics is built on Roman foundations; and
Spanish cuisine and architecture owe a far greater debt to Roman legacies than to
those of the Celts of Iberia. Nothing is really left of Numantia save ruins. Even its
story has reached us thanks only to the writings of Roman historians. It was
tailored to the tastes of Roman audiences which relished tales of freedom-loving
barbarians. The victory of Rome over Numantia was so complete that the victors
co-opted the very memory of the vanquished.
It’s not our kind of story. We like to see underdogs win. But there is no justice in
history. Most past cultures have sooner or later fallen prey to the armies of some
ruthless empire, which have consigned them to oblivion. Empires, too, ultimately
fall, but they tend to leave behind rich and enduring legacies. Almost all people in
the twenty-first century are the offspring of one empire or another.

What is an Empire?

An empire is a political order with two important characteristics. First, to qualify
for that designation you have to rule over a signiɹcant number of distinct peoples,
each possessing a diʃerent cultural identity and a separate territory. How many
peoples exactly? Two or three is not suɽcient. Twenty or thirty is plenty. The
imperial threshold passes somewhere in between.
Second, empires are characterised by ɻexible borders and a potentially
unlimited appetite. They can swallow and digest more and more nations and
territories without altering their basic structure or identity. The British state of
today has fairly clear borders that cannot be exceeded without altering the
fundamental structure and identity of the state. A century ago almost any place
on earth could have become part of the British Empire.
Cultural diversity and territorial ɻexibility give empires not only their unique
character, but also their central role in history. It’s thanks to these two
characteristics that empires have managed to unite diverse ethnic groups and

ecological zones under a single political umbrella, thereby fusing together larger
and larger segments of the human species and of planet Earth.
It should be stressed that an empire is deɹned solely by its cultural diversity and
ɻexible borders, rather than by its origins, its form of government, its territorial
extent, or the size of its population. An empire need not emerge from military
conquest. The Athenian Empire began its life as a voluntary league, and the
Habsburg Empire was born in wedlock, cobbled together by a string of shrewd
marriage alliances. Nor must an empire be ruled by an autocratic emperor. The
British Empire, the largest empire in history, was ruled by a democracy. Other
democratic (or at least republican) empires have included the modern Dutch,
French, Belgian and American empires, as well as the premodern empires of
Novgorod, Rome, Carthage and Athens.
Size, too, does not really matter. Empires can be puny. The Athenian Empire at
its zenith was much smaller in size and population than today’s Greece. The Aztec
Empire was smaller than today’s Mexico. Both were nevertheless empires, whereas
modern Greece and modern Mexico are not, because the former gradually subdued
dozens and even hundreds of diʃerent polities while the latter have not. Athens
lorded it over more than a hundred formerly independent city states, whereas the
Aztec Empire, if we can trust its taxation records, ruled 371 diʃerent tribes and
peoples.1
How was it possible to squeeze such a human potpourri into the territory of a
modest modern state? It was possible because in the past there were many more
distinct peoples in the world, each of which had a smaller population and
occupied less territory than today’s typical people. The land between the
Mediterranean and the Jordan River, which today struggles to satisfy the
ambitions of just two peoples, easily accommodated in biblical times dozens of
nations, tribes, petty kingdoms and city states.
Empires were one of the main reasons for the drastic reduction in human
diversity. The imperial steamroller gradually obliterated the unique characteristics
of numerous peoples (such as the Numantians), forging out of them new and much
larger groups.

Evil Empires?

In our time, ‘imperialist’ ranks second only to ‘fascist’ in the lexicon of political
swear words. The contemporary critique of empires commonly takes two forms:
1. Empires do not work. In the long run, it is not possible to rule eʃectively
over a large number of conquered peoples.

2. Even if it can be done, it should not be done, because empires are evil

engines of destruction and exploitation. Every people has a right to self-
determination, and should never be subject to the rule of another.

From a historical perspective, the ɹrst statement is plain nonsense, and the
second is deeply problematic.
The truth is that empire has been the world’s most common form of political
organisation for the last 2,500 years. Most humans during these two and a half
millennia have lived in empires. Empire is also a very stable form of government.
Most empires have found it alarmingly easy to put down rebellions. In general,
they have been toppled only by external invasion or by a split within the ruling
elite. Conversely, conquered peoples don’t have a very good record of freeing
themselves from their imperial overlords. Most have remained subjugated for
hundreds of years. Typically, they have been slowly digested by the conquering
empire, until their distinct cultures fizzled out.
For example, when the Western Roman Empire ɹnally fell to invading
Germanic tribes in 476 AD, the Numantians, Arverni, Helvetians, Samnites,
Lusitanians, Umbrians, Etruscans and hundreds of other forgotten peoples whom
the Romans conquered centuries earlier did not emerge from the empires
eviscerated carcass like Jonah from the belly of the great ɹsh. None of them were
left. The biological descendants of the people who had identiɹed themselves as
members of those nations, who had spoken their languages, worshipped their gods
and told their myths and legends, now thought, spoke and worshipped as Romans.
In many cases, the destruction of one empire hardly meant independence for
subject peoples. Instead, a new empire stepped into the vacuum created when the
old one collapsed or retreated. Nowhere has this been more obvious than in the
Middle East. The current political constellation in that region – a balance of
power between many independent political entities with more or less stable
borders – is almost without parallel any time in the last several millennia. The last
time the Middle East experienced such a situation was in the eighth century BC –
almost 3,000 years ago! From the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the eighth
century BC until the collapse of the British and French empires in the mid-twentieth
century AD, the Middle East passed from the hands of one empire into the hands of
another, like a baton in a relay race. And by the time the British and French
ɹnally dropped the baton, the Aramaeans, the Ammonites, the Phoenicians, the
Philistines, the Moabites, the Edomites and the other peoples conquered by the
Assyrians had long disappeared.
True, today’s Jews, Armenians and Georgians claim with some measure of
justice that they are the oʃspring of ancient Middle Eastern peoples. Yet these are
only exceptions that prove the rule, and even these claims are somewhat

exaggerated. It goes without saying that the political, economic and social
practices of modern Jews, for example, owe far more to the empires under which
they lived during the past two millennia than to the traditions of the ancient
kingdom of Judaea. If King David were to show up in an ultra-Orthodox
synagogue in present-day Jerusalem, he would be utterly bewildered to ɹnd
people dressed in East European clothes, speaking in a German dialect (Yiddish)
and having endless arguments about the meaning of a Babylonian text (the
Talmud). There were neither synagogues, volumes of Talmud, nor even Torah
scrolls in ancient Judaea.

Building and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious slaughter of large
populations and the brutal oppression of everyone who was left. The standard
imperial toolkit included wars, enslavement, deportation and genocide. When the
Romans invaded Scotland in AD 83, they were met by ɹerce resistance from local
Caledonian tribes, and reacted by laying waste to the country. In reply to Roman
peace oʃers, the chieftain Calgacus called the Romans ‘the ruɽans of the world’,
and said that ‘to plunder, slaughter and robbery they give the lying name of
empire; they make a desert and call it peace’.2
This does not mean, however, that empires leave nothing of value in their
wake. To colour all empires black and to disavow all imperial legacies is to reject
most of human culture. Imperial elites used the proɹts of conquest to ɹnance not
only armies and forts but also philosophy, art, justice and charity. A signiɹcant
proportion of humanity’s cultural achievements owe their existence to the
exploitation of conquered populations. The proɹts and prosperity brought by
Roman imperialism provided Cicero, Seneca and St Augustine with the leisure and
wherewithal to think and write; the Taj Mahal could not have been built without
the wealth accumulated by Mughal exploitation of their Indian subjects; and the

Habsburg Empire’s proɹts from its rule over its Slavic, Hungarian and Romanian-
speaking provinces paid Haydn’s salaries and Mozart’s commissions. No

Caledonian writer preserved Calgacus’ speech for posterity. We know of it thanks
to the Roman historian Tacitus. In fact, Tacitus probably made it up. Most scholars
today agree that Tacitus not only fabricated the speech but invented the character
of Calgacus, the Caledonian chieftain, to serve as a mouthpiece for what he and
other upper-class Romans thought about their own country.
Even if we look beyond elite culture and high art, and focus instead on the
world of common people, we ɹnd imperial legacies in the majority of modern
cultures. Today most of us speak, think and dream in imperial languages that
were forced upon our ancestors by the sword. Most East Asians speak and dream
in the language of the Han Empire. No matter what their origins, nearly all the
inhabitants of the two American continents, from Alaska’s Barrow Peninsula to

the Straits of Magellan, communicate in one of four imperial languages: Spanish,
Portuguese, French or English. Present-day Egyptians speak Arabic, think of
themselves as Arabs, and identify wholeheartedly with the Arab Empire that
conquered Egypt in the seventh century and crushed with an iron ɹst the repeated
revolts that broke out against its rule. About 10 million Zulus in South Africa hark
back to the Zulu age of glory in the nineteenth century, even though most of them
descend from tribes who fought against the Zulu Empire, and were incorporated
into it only through bloody military campaigns.
