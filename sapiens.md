It seems that about 50,000 years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals and
Denisovans were at that borderline point. They were almost, but not
quite, entirely separate species. As we shall see in the next chapter,
Sapiens were already very different from Neanderthals and Denisovans
not only in their genetic code and physical traits, but also in their
cognitive and social abilities, yet it appears it was still just possible, on
rare occasions, for a Sapiens and a Neanderthal to produce a fertile
offspring. So the populations did not merge, but a few lucky Neanderthal
genes did hitch a ride on the Sapiens Express. It is unsettling – and
perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex
with an animal from a different species, and produce children together.
3. A speculative reconstruction of a Neanderthal child. Genetic evidence hints that at least
some Neanderthals may have had fair skin and hair.
But if the Neanderthals, Denisovans and other human species didn’t
merge with Sapiens, why did they vanish? One possibility is that Homo
sapiens drove them to extinction. Imagine a Sapiens band reaching a
Balkan valley where Neanderthals had lived for hundreds of thousands
of years. The newcomers began to hunt the deer and gather the nuts and
berries that were the Neanderthals’ traditional staples. Sapiens were
more proficient hunters and gatherers – thanks to better technology and
superior social skills – so they multiplied and spread. The less
resourceful Neanderthals found it increasingly difficult to feed
themselves. Their population dwindled and they slowly died out, except
perhaps for one or two members who joined their Sapiens neighbours.
Another possibility is that competition for resources flared up into
violence and genocide. Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern
times, a small difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been
enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating
another group. Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards
an entirely different human species? It may well be that when Sapiens
encountered Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant
ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.
Whichever way it happened, the Neanderthals (and the other human
species) pose one of history’s great what ifs. Imagine how things might
have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans survived alongside
Homo sapiens. What kind of cultures, societies and political structures
would have emerged in a world where several different human species
coexisted? How, for example, would religious faiths have unfolded?
Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend
from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the
Denisovans, and would the Qur’an have reserved seats in heaven for all
righteous humans, whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have
been able to serve in the Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy
of imperial China? Would the American Declaration of Independence
hold as a self-evident truth that all members of the genus Homo are
created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged workers of all species to
unite?
Over the past 10,000 years, Homo sapiens has grown so accustomed to
being the only human species that it’s hard for us to conceive of any
other possibility. Our lack of brothers and sisters makes it easier to
imagine that we are the epitome of creation, and that a chasm separates
us from the rest of the animal kingdom. When Charles Darwin indicated
that Homo sapiens was just another kind of animal, people were
outraged. Even today many refuse to believe it. Had the Neanderthals
survived, would we still imagine ourselves to be a creature apart?
Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals.
They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate.
Whether Sapiens are to blame or not, no sooner had they arrived at a
new location than the native population became extinct. The last
remains of Homo soloensis are dated to about 50,000 years ago. Homo
denisova disappeared shortly thereafter. Neanderthals made their exit
roughly 30,000 years ago. The last dwarf-like humans vanished from
Flores Island about 12,000 years ago. They left behind some bones, stone
tools, a few genes in our DNA and a lot of unanswered questions. They
also left behind us, Homo sapiens, the last human species.
What was the Sapiens’ secret of success? How did we manage to settle
so rapidly in so many distant and ecologically different habitats? How
did we push all other human species into oblivion? Why couldn’t even
the strong, brainy, cold-proof Neanderthals survive our onslaught? The
debate continues to rage. The most likely answer is the very thing that
makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks
above all to its unique language.
2
The Tree of Knowledge
IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER WE SAW THAT although Sapiens had
already populated East Africa 150,000 years ago, they began to overrun
the rest of planet Earth and drive the other human species to extinction
only about 70,000 years ago. In the intervening millennia, even though
these archaic Sapiens looked just like us and their brains were as big as
ours, they did not enjoy any marked advantage over other human
species, did not produce particularly sophisticated tools, and did not
accomplish any other special feats.
In fact, in the first recorded encounter between Sapiens and
Neanderthals, the Neanderthals won. About 100,000 years ago, some
Sapiens groups migrated north to the Levant, which was Neanderthal
territory, but failed to secure a firm footing. It might have been due to
nasty natives, an inclement climate, or unfamiliar local parasites.
Whatever the reason, the Sapiens eventually retreated, leaving the
Neanderthals as masters of the Middle East.
This poor record of achievement has led scholars to speculate that the
internal structure of the brains of these Sapiens was probably different
from ours. They looked like us, but their cognitive abilities – learning,
remembering, communicating – were far more limited. Teaching such an
ancient Sapiens English, persuading him of the truth of Christian dogma,
or getting him to understand the theory of evolution would probably
have been hopeless undertakings. Conversely, we would have had a very
hard time learning his language and understanding his way of thinking.
But then, beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started
doing very special things. Around that date Sapiens bands left Africa for
a second time. This time they drove the Neanderthals and all other
human species not only from the Middle East, but from the face of the
earth. Within a remarkably short period, Sapiens reached Europe and
East Asia. About 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea
and landed in Australia – a continent hitherto untouched by humans.
The period from about 70,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago
witnessed the invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and
needles (essential for sewing warm clothing). The first objects that can
reliably be called art date from this era (see the Stadel lion-man on this
page), as does the first clear evidence for religion, commerce and social
stratification.
Most researchers believe that these unprecedented accomplishments
were the product of a revolution in Sapiens’ cognitive abilities. They
maintain that the people who drove the Neanderthals to extinction,
settled Australia, and carved the Stadel lion-man were as intelligent,
creative and sensitive as we are. If we were to come across the artists of
the Stadel Cave, we could learn their language and they ours. We’d be
able to explain to them everything we know – from the adventures of
Alice in Wonderland to the paradoxes of quantum physics – and they
could teach us how their people view the world.
The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between
70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What
caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues
that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains
of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to
communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it
the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather
than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as
we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of
the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes. What was so special
about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world?
*
It was not the first language. Every animal has some kind of language.
Even insects, such as bees and ants, know how to communicate in
sophisticated ways, informing one another of the whereabouts of food.
Neither was it the first vocal language. Many animals, including all ape
and monkey species, have vocal languages. For example, green monkeys
use calls of various kinds to communicate. Zoologists have identified one
call that means, ‘Careful! An eagle!’ A slightly different call warns,
‘Careful! A lion!’ When researchers played a recording of the first call to
a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what they were doing and
looked upwards in fear. When the same group heard a recording of the
second call, the lion warning, they quickly scrambled up a tree. Sapiens
can produce many more distinct sounds than green monkeys, but whales
and elephants have equally impressive abilities. A parrot can say
anything Albert Einstein could say, as well as mimicking the sounds of
phones ringing, doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever advantage
Einstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so special
about our language?
The most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple.
We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an
infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can
thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of
information about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its
comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that
this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd
of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different
paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her
band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to
approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.
A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means
of sharing information about the world. But the most important
information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about
lions and bison. Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According
to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social
cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. It is not enough for
individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison.
It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates
whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.
4. An ivory figurine of a ‘lion-man’ (or ‘lioness-woman’) from the Stadel Cave in Germany
(c.32,000 years ago). The body is human, but the head is leonine. This is one of the first
indisputable examples of art, and probably of religion, and of the ability of the human
mind to imagine things that do not really exist.
The amount of information that one must obtain and store in order to
track the ever-changing relationships of a few dozen individuals is
staggering. (In a band of fifty individuals, there are 1,225 one-on-one
relationships, and countless more complex social combinations.) All apes
show a keen interest in such social information, but they have trouble
gossiping effectively. Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens probably
also had a hard time talking behind each other’s backs – a much
maligned ability which is in fact essential for cooperation in large
numbers. The new linguistic skills that modern Sapiens acquired about
seventy millennia ago enabled them to gossip for hours on end. Reliable
information about who could be trusted meant that small bands could
expand into larger bands, and Sapiens could develop tighter and more
sophisticated types of cooperation.1
The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies
support it. Even today the vast majority of human communication –
whether in the form of emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is
gossip. It comes so naturally to us that it seems as if our language
evolved for this very purpose. Do you think that history professors chat
about the reasons for World War One when they meet for lunch, or that
nuclear physicists spend their coffee breaks at scientific conferences
talking about quarks? Sometimes. But more often, they gossip about the
professor who caught her husband cheating, or the quarrel between the
head of the department and the dean, or the rumours that a colleague
used his research funds to buy a Lexus. Gossip usually focuses on
wrongdoings. Rumour-mongers are the original fourth estate, journalists
who inform society about and thus protect it from cheats and
freeloaders.
Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river
theory are valid. Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its
ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the
ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As
far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that
they have never seen, touched or smelled.
Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the
Cognitive Revolution. Many animals and human species could previously
say, ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens
acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe.’
This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens
language.
It’s relatively easy to agree that only Homo sapiens can speak about
things that don’t really exist, and believe six impossible things before
breakfast. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by
promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. But why
is it important? After all, fiction can be dangerously misleading or
distracting. People who go to the forest looking for fairies and unicorns
would seem to have less chance of survival than people who go looking
for mushrooms and deer. And if you spend hours praying to non-existing
guardian spirits, aren’t you wasting precious time, time better spent
foraging, fighting and fornicating?
But fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so
collectively. We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation
story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the
nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the
unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and
bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a very
rigid manner and only with close relatives. Wolves and chimpanzees
cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small
numbers of other individuals that they know intimately. Sapiens can
cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of
strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our
leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
The Legend of Peugeot
Our chimpanzee cousins usually live in small troops of several dozen
individuals. They form close friendships, hunt together and fight
shoulder to shoulder against baboons, cheetahs and enemy chimpanzees.
Their social structure tends to be hierarchical. The dominant member,
who is almost always a male, is termed the ‘alpha male’. Other males
and females exhibit their submission to the alpha male by bowing before
him while making grunting sounds, not unlike human subjects
kowtowing before a king. The alpha male strives to maintain social
harmony within his troop. When two individuals fight, he will intervene
and stop the violence. Less benevolently, he might monopolise
particularly coveted foods and prevent lower-ranking males from mating
with the females.
When two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so
by forming extensive coalitions of supporters, both male and female,
from within the group. Ties between coalition members are based on
intimate daily contact – hugging, touching, kissing, grooming and
mutual favours. Just as human politicians on election campaigns go
around shaking hands and kissing babies, so aspirants to the top position
in a chimpanzee group spend much time hugging, back-slapping and
kissing baby chimps. The alpha male usually wins his position not
because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable
coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt
struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities.
Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help
one another in times of trouble.
There are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and
maintained in such a way. In order to function, all members of a group
must know each other intimately. Two chimpanzees who have never
met, never fought, and never engaged in mutual grooming will not know
whether they can trust one another, whether it would be worthwhile to
help one another, and which of them ranks higher. Under natural
conditions, a typical chimpanzee troop consists of about twenty to fifty
individuals. As the number of chimpanzees in a troop increases, the
social order destabilises, eventually leading to a rupture and the
formation of a new troop by some of the animals. Only in a handful of
cases have zoologists observed groups larger than a hundred. Separate
groups seldom cooperate, and tend to compete for territory and food.
Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups, and
even one case of ‘genocidal’ activity in which one troop systematically
slaughtered most members of a neighbouring band.2
Similar patterns probably dominated the social lives of early humans,
including archaic Homo sapiens. Humans, like chimps, have social
instincts that enabled our ancestors to form friendships and hierarchies,
and to hunt or fight together. However, like the social instincts of
chimps, those of humans were adapted only for small intimate groups.
When the group grew too large, its social order destabilised and the
band split. Even if a particularly fertile valley could feed 500 archaic
Sapiens, there was no way that so many strangers could live together.
How could they agree who should be leader, who should hunt where, or
who should mate with whom?
In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens
to form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits.
Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a
group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can
neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150
human beings.
Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls
somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold,
communities, businesses, social networks and military units can
maintain themselves based mainly on intimate acquaintance and
rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law
books to keep order.3 A platoon of thirty soldiers or even a company of a
hundred soldiers can function well on the basis of intimate relations,
with a minimum of formal discipline. A well-respected sergeant can
become ‘king of the company and exercise authority even over
commissioned officers. A small family business can survive and flourish
without a board of directors, a CEO or an accounting department.
But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no
longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of
soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses
usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If
they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.
How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold,
eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants
and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the
appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate
successfully by believing in common myths.
Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a
medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in
common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination.
Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who
have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to
build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in
human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins.
States are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never
met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in
the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the
Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths. Two
lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend
a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws,
justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees.
Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent
and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no
money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common
imagination of human beings.
People easily understand that ‘primitives’ cement their social order by
believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance
together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our
modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Take for example
the world of business corporations. Modern business-people and lawyers
are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them
and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales. The
legend of Peugeot affords us a good example.
An icon that somewhat resembles the Stadel lion-man appears today on
cars, trucks and motorcycles from Paris to Sydney. It’s the hood
ornament that adorns vehicles made by Peugeot, one of the oldest and
largest of Europe’s carmakers. Peugeot began as a small family business
in the village of Valentigney, just 300 kilometres from the Stadel Cave.
Today the company employs about 200,000 people worldwide, most of
whom are complete strangers to each other. These strangers cooperate so
effectively that in 2008 Peugeot produced more than 1.5 million
automobiles, earning revenues of about 55 billion euros.
In what sense can we say that Peugeot SA (the company’s official
name) exists? There are many Peugeot vehicles, but these are obviously
not the company. Even if every Peugeot in the world were
simultaneously junked and sold for scrap metal, Peugeot SA would not
disappear. It would continue to manufacture new cars and issue its
annual report. The company owns factories, machinery and showrooms,
and employs mechanics, accountants and secretaries, but all these
together do not comprise Peugeot. A disaster might kill every single one
of Peugeot’s employees, and go on to destroy all of its assembly lines and
executive offices. Even then, the company could borrow money, hire
new employees, build new factories and buy new machinery. Peugeot
has managers and shareholders, but neither do they constitute the
company. All the managers could be dismissed and all its shares sold,
but the company itself would remain intact.
5. The Peugeot Lion
It doesn’t mean that Peugeot SA is invulnerable or immortal. If a judge
were to mandate the dissolution of the company, its factories would
remain standing and its workers, accountants, managers and
shareholders would continue to live – but Peugeot SA would
immediately vanish. In short, Peugeot SA seems to have no essential
connection to the physical world. Does it really exist?
Peugeot is a figment of our collective imagination. Lawyers call this a
‘legal fiction’. It can’t be pointed at; it is not a physical object. But it
exists as a legal entity. Just like you or me, it is bound by the laws of the
countries in which it operates. It can open a bank account and own
property. It pays taxes, and it can be sued and even prosecuted
separately from any of the people who own or work for it.
Peugeot belongs to a particular genre of legal fictions called ‘limited
liability companies’. The idea behind such companies is among
humanity’s most ingenious inventions. Homo sapiens lived for untold
millennia without them. During most of recorded history property could
be owned only by flesh-and-blood humans, the kind that stood on two
legs and had big brains. If in thirteenth-century France Jean set up a
wagon-manufacturing workshop, he himself was the business. If a wagon
he’d made broke down a week after purchase, the disgruntled buyer
would have sued Jean personally. If Jean had borrowed 1,000 gold coins
to set up his workshop and the business failed, he would have had to
repay the loan by selling his private property – his house, his cow, his
land. He might even have had to sell his children into servitude. If he
couldn’t cover the debt, he could be thrown in prison by the state or
enslaved by his creditors. He was fully liable, without limit, for all
obligations incurred by his workshop.
If you had lived back then, you would probably have thought twice
before you opened an enterprise of your own. And indeed this legal
situation discouraged entrepreneurship. People were afraid to start new
businesses and take economic risks. It hardly seemed worth taking the
chance that their families could end up utterly destitute.
This is why people began collectively to imagine the existence of
limited liability companies. Such companies were legally independent of
the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed
them. Over the last few centuries such companies have become the main
players in the economic arena, and we have grown so used to them that
we forget they exist only in our imagination. In the US, the technical
term for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic,
because the term derives from ‘corpus’ (‘body’ in Latin) – the one thing
these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the
American legal system treats corporations as legal persons, as if they
were flesh-and-blood human beings.
And so did the French legal system back in 1896, when Armand
Peugeot, who had inherited from his parents a metalworking shop that
produced springs, saws and bicycles, decided to go into the automobile
business. To that end, he set up a limited liability company. He named
the company after himself, but it was independent of him. If one of the
cars broke down, the buyer could sue Peugeot, but not Armand Peugeot.
If the company borrowed millions of francs and then went bust, Armand
Peugeot did not owe its creditors a single franc. The loan, after all, had
been given to Peugeot, the company, not to Armand Peugeot, the Homo
sapiens. Armand Peugeot died in 1915. Peugeot, the company, is still
alive and well.
How exactly did Armand Peugeot, the man, create Peugeot, the
company? In much the same way that priests and sorcerers have created
gods and demons throughout history, and in which thousands of French
curés were still creating Christ’s body every Sunday in the parish
churches. It all revolved around telling stories, and convincing people to
believe them. In the case of the French curés, the crucial story was that
of Christ’s life and death as told by the Catholic Church. According to
this story, if a Catholic priest dressed in his sacred garments solemnly
said the right words at the right moment, mundane bread and wine
turned into God’s flesh and blood. The priest exclaimed ‘Hoc est corpus
meum!’ (Latin for ‘This is my body!’) and hocus pocus – the bread turned
into Christ’s flesh. Seeing that the priest had properly and assiduously
observed all the procedures, millions of devout French Catholics behaved
as if God really existed in the consecrated bread and wine.
In the case of Peugeot SA the crucial story was the French legal code,
as written by the French parliament. According to the French legislators,
if a certified lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals, wrote all
the required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper,
and affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then
hocus pocus – a new company was incorporated. When in 1896 Armand
Peugeot wanted to create his company, he paid a lawyer to go through
all these sacred procedures. Once the lawyer had performed all the right
rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of
upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really
existed.
Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the
story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history
revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people
to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability
companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power,
because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards
common goals. Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to
create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about
things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.
Over the years, people have woven an incredibly complex network of
stories. Within this network, fictions such as Peugeot not only exist, but
also accumulate immense power. The kinds of things that people create
through this network of stories are known in academic circles as
‘fictions’, ‘social constructs’, or ‘imagined realities’. An imagined reality
is not a lie. I lie when I say that there is a lion near the river when I
know perfectly well that there is no lion there. There is nothing special
about lies. Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for
example, has been observed calling ‘Careful! A lion!’ when there was no
lion around. This alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey
who had just found a banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize
for itself.
Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes
in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality
exerts force in the world. The sculptor from the Stadel Cave may
sincerely have believed in the existence of the lion-man guardian spirit.
Some sorcerers are charlatans, but most sincerely believe in the
existence of gods and demons. Most millionaires sincerely believe in the
existence of money and limited liability companies. Most human-rights
activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights. No one was
lying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government
respect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and
human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations.
Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a
dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and
lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and
corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more
powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions
depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and
corporations.

Bypassing the Genome
The ability to create an imagined reality out of words enabled large
numbers of strangers to cooperate effectively. But it also did something
more. Since large-scale human cooperation is based on myths, the way
people cooperate can be altered by changing the myths – by telling
different stories. Under the right circumstances myths can change
rapidly. In 1789 the French population switched almost overnight from
believing in the myth of the divine right of kings to believing in the
myth of the sovereignty of the people. Consequently,ever since the
Cognitive Revolution Homo sapiens has been able to revise its behaviour
rapidly in accordance with changing needs. This opened a fast lane of
cultural evolution, bypassing the traffic jams of genetic evolution.
Speeding down this fast lane, Homo sapiens soon far outstripped all other
human and animal species in its ability to cooperate.
The behaviour of other social animals is determined to a large extent
by their genes. DNA is not an autocrat. Animal behaviour is also
influenced by environmental factors and individual quirks. Nevertheless,
in a given environment, animals of the same species will tend to behave
in a similar way. Significant changes in social behaviour cannot occur, in
general, without genetic mutations. For example, common chimpanzees
have a genetic tendency to live in hierarchical groups headed by an
alpha male. Members of a closely related chimpanzee species, bonobos,
usually live in more egalitarian groups dominated by female alliances.
Female common chimpanzees cannot take lessons from their bonobo
relatives and stage a feminist revolution. Male chimps cannot gather in a
constitutional assembly to abolish the office of alpha male and declare
that from here on out all chimps are to be treated as equals. Such
dramatic changes in behaviour would occur only if something changed
in the chimpanzees’ DNA.
For similar reasons, archaic humans did not initiate any revolutions.
As far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new
technologies and the settlement of alien habitats resulted from genetic
mutations and environmental pressures more than from cultural
initiatives. This is why it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to
make these steps. Two million years ago, genetic mutations resulted in
the appearance of a new human species called Homo erectus. Its
emergence was accompanied by the development of a new stone tool
technology, now recognised as a defining feature of this species. As long
as Homo erectus did not undergo further genetic alterations, its stone
tools remained roughly the same – for close to 2 million years!
In contrast, ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been
able to change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to
future generations without any need of genetic or environmental change.
As a prime example, consider the repeated appearance of childless elites,
such as the Catholic priesthood, Buddhist monastic orders and Chinese
eunuch bureaucracies. The existence of such elites goes against the most
fundamental principles of natural selection, since these dominant
members of society willingly give up procreation. Whereas chimpanzee
alpha males use their power to have sex with as many females as
possible – and consequently sire a large proportion of their troop’s young
– the Catholic alpha male abstains completely from sexual intercourse
and childcare. This abstinence does not result from unique
environmental conditions such as a severe lack of food or want of
potential mates. Nor is it the result of some quirky genetic mutation. The
Catholic Church has survived for centuries, not by passing on a ‘celibacy
gene’ from one pope to the next, but by passing on the stories of the New
Testament and of Catholic canon law.
In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans
remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform
their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their
economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or
two. Consider a resident of Berlin, born in 1900 and living to the ripe
age of one hundred. She spent her childhood in the Hohenzollern Empire
of Wilhelm II; her adult years in the Weimar Republic, the Nazi Third
Reich and Communist East Germany; and she died a citizen of a
democratic and reunified Germany. She had managed to be a part of five
very different sociopolitical systems, though her DNA remained exactly
the same.
This was the key to Sapiens’ success. In a one-on-one brawl, a
Neanderthal would probably have beaten a Sapiens. But in a conflict of
hundreds, Neanderthals wouldn’t stand a chance. Neanderthals could
share information about the whereabouts of lions, but they probably
could not tell – and revise – stories about tribal spirits. Without an
ability to compose fiction, Neanderthals were unable to cooperate
effectively in large numbers, nor could they adapt their social behaviour
to rapidly changing challenges.
While we can’t get inside a Neanderthal mind to understand how they
thought, we have indirect evidence of the limits to their cognition
compared with their Sapiens rivals. Archaeologists excavating 30,000-
year-old Sapiens sites in the European heartland occasionally find there
seashells from the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. In all likelihood,
these shells got to the continental interior through long-distance trade
between different Sapiens bands. Neanderthal sites lack any evidence of
such trade. Each group manufactured its own tools from local materials.4
6. The Catholic alpha male abstains from sexual intercourse and childcare, even though
there is no genetic or ecological reason for him to do so.
Another example comes from the South Pacific. Sapiens bands that
lived on the island of New Ireland, north of New Guinea, used a volcanic
glass called obsidian to manufacture particularly strong and sharp tools.
New Ireland, however, has no natural deposits of obsidian. Laboratory
tests revealed that the obsidian they used was brought from deposits on
New Britain, an island 400 kilometres away. Some of the inhabitants of
these islands must have been skilled navigators who traded from island
to island over long distances.5
Trade may seem a very pragmatic activity, one that needs no fictive
basis. Yet the fact is that no animal other than Sapiens engages in trade,
and all the Sapiens trade neworks about which we have detailed
evidence were based on fictions. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it
is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is
based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal
Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two
strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust
by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.
If archaic Sapiens believing in such fictions traded shells and obsidian,
it stands to reason that they could also have traded information, thus
creating a much denser and wider knowledge network than the one that
served Neanderthals and other archaic humans.
Hunting techniques provide another illustration of these differences.
Neanderthals usually hunted alone or in small groups. Sapiens, on the
other hand, developed techniques that relied on cooperation between
many dozens of individuals, and perhaps even between different bands.
One particularly effective method was to surround an entire herd of
animals, such as wild horses, then chase them into a narrow gorge,
where it was easy to slaughter them en masse. If all went according to
plan, the bands could harvest tons of meat, fat and animal skins in a
single afternoon of collective effort, and either consume these riches in a
giant potlatch, or dry, smoke or (in Arctic areas) freeze them for later
usage. Archaeologists have discovered sites where entire herds were
butchered annually in such ways. There are even sites where fences and
obstacles were erected in order to create artificial traps and slaughtering
grounds.
We may presume that Neanderthals were not pleased to see their
traditional hunting grounds turned into Sapiens-controlled
slaughterhouses. However, if violence broke out between the two
species, Neanderthals were not much better off than wild horses. Fifty
Neanderthals cooperating in traditional and static patterns were no
match for 500 versatile and innovative Sapiens. And even if the Sapiens
lost the first round, they could quickly invent new stratagems that would
enable them to win the next time.

History and Biology
The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and
the resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of
what we call ‘cultures’. Once cultures appeared, they never ceased to
change and develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call
‘history’.
The Cognitive Revolution is accordingly the point when history
declared its independence from biology. Until the Cognitive Revolution,
the doings of all human species belonged to the realm of biology, or, if
you so prefer, prehistory (I tend to avoid the term ‘prehistory’, because it
wrongly implies that even before the Cognitive Revolution, humans were
in a category of their own). From the Cognitive Revolution onwards,
historical narratives replace biological theories as our primary means of
explaining the development of Homo sapiens. To understand the rise of
Christianity or the French Revolution, it is not enough to comprehend
the interaction of genes, hormones and organisms. It is necessary to take
into account the interaction of ideas, images and fantasies as well.
This does not mean that Homo sapiens and human culture became
exempt from biological laws. We are still animals, and our physical,
emotional and cognitive abilities are still shaped by our DNA. Our
societies are built from the same building blocks as Neanderthal or
chimpanzee societies, and the more we examine these building blocks –
sensations, emotions, family ties – the less difference we find between us
and other apes.
It is, however, a mistake to look for the differences at the level of the
individual or the family. One on one, even ten on ten, we are
embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to
appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when
we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding. If you
tried to bunch together thousands of chimpanzees into Tiananmen
Square, Wall Street, the Vatican or the headquarters of the United
Nations, the result would be pandemonium. By contrast, Sapiens
regularly gather by the thousands in such places. Together, they create
orderly patterns – such as trade networks, mass celebrations and
political institutions – that they could never have created in isolation.
The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue
that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups.
This glue has made us the masters of creation.
Of course, we also needed other skills, such as the ability to make and
use tools. Yet tool-making is of little consequence unless it is coupled
with the ability to cooperate with many others. How is it that we now
have intercontinental missiles with nuclear warheads, whereas 30,000
years ago we had only sticks with flint spearheads? Physiologically,
there has been no significant improvement in our tool-making capacity
over the last 30,000 years. Albert Einstein was far less dexterous with his
hands than was an ancient hunter-gatherer. However, our capacity to
cooperate with large numbers of strangers has improved dramatically.
The ancient flint spearhead was manufactured in minutes by a single
person, who relied on the advice and help of a few intimate friends. The
production of a modern nuclear warhead requires the cooperation of
millions of strangers all over the world – from the workers who mine the
uranium ore in the depths of the earth to theoretical physicists who
write long mathematical formulas to describe the interactions of
subatomic particles.
To summarise the relationship between biology and history after the
Cognitive Revolution:
a. Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of
Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of
this biological arena.
b. However, this arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play
an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent
fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each
generation develops and elaborates even further.
c. Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must
describe the historical evolution of their actions. Referring only to our
biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who,
attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a
detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of
what the players are doing.
What games did our Stone Age ancestors play in the arena of history? As
far as we know, the people who carved the Stadel lion-man some 30,000
years ago had the same physical, emotional and intellectual abilities we
have. What did they do when they woke up in the morning? What did
they eat for breakfast – and lunch? What were their societies like? Did
they have monogamous relationships and nuclear families? Did they
have ceremonies, moral codes, sports contests and religious rituals? Did
they fight wars? The next chapter takes a peek behind the curtain of the
ages, examining what life was like in the millennia separating the
Cognitive Revolution from the Agricultural Revolution.
* Here and in the following pages, when speaking about Sapiens language, I refer to the basic
linguistic abilities of our species and not to a particular dialect. English, Hindi and Chinese are
all variants of Sapiens language. Apparently, even at the time of the Cognitive Revolution,
different Sapiens groups had different dialects.

A Day in the Life of Adam and Eve
TO UNDERSTAND OUR NATURE, HISTORY and psychology, we must
get inside the heads of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. For nearly the
entire history of our species, Sapiens lived as foragers. The past 200
years, during which ever increasing numbers of Sapiens have obtained
their daily bread as urban labourers and office workers, and the
preceding 10,000 years, during which most Sapiens lived as farmers and
herders, are the blink of an eye compared to the tens of thousands of
years during which our ancestors hunted and gathered.
The flourishing field of evolutionary psychology argues that many of
our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped
during this long pre-agricultural era. Even today, scholars in this field
claim, our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and
gathering. Our eating habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the
result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current
post-industrial environment, with its mega-cities, aeroplanes, telephones
and computers. This environment gives us more material resources and
longer lives than those enjoyed by any previous generation, but it often
makes us feel alienated, depressed and pressured. To understand why,
evolutionary psychologists argue, we need to delve into the huntergatherer world that shaped us, the world that we subconsciously still
inhabit.
Why, for example, do people gorge on high-calorie food that is doing
little good to their bodies? Today’s affluent societies are in the throes of
a plague of obesity, which is rapidly spreading to developing countries.
It’s a puzzle why we binge on the sweetest and greasiest food we can
find, until we consider the eating habits of our forager forebears. In the
savannahs and forests they inhabited, high-calorie sweets were
extremely rare and food in general was in short supply. A typical forager
30,000 years ago had access to only one type of sweet food – ripe fruit.
If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most
sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot,
before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge
on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes. Today we may be
living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed refrigerators, but our
DNA still thinks we are in the savannah. That’s what makes us spoon
down an entire tub of Ben & Jerry’s when we find one in the freezer and
wash it down with a jumbo Coke.
This ‘gorging gene’ theory is widely accepted. Other theories are far
more contentious. For example, some evolutionary psychologists argue
that ancient foraging bands were not composed of nuclear families
centred on monogamous couples. Rather, foragers lived in communes
devoid of private property, monogamous relationships and even
fatherhood. In such a band, a woman could have sex and form intimate
bonds with several men (and women) simultaneously, and all of the
band’s adults cooperated in parenting its children. Since no man knew
definitively which of the children were his, men showed equal concern
for all youngsters.
Such a social structure is not an Aquarian utopia. It’s well documented
among animals, notably our closest relatives, the chimpanzees and
bonobos. There are even a number of present-day human cultures in
which collective fatherhood is practised, as for example among the Barí
Indians. According to the beliefs of such societies, a child is not born
from the sperm of a single man, but from the accumulation of sperm in a
woman’s womb. A good mother will make a point of having sex with
several different men, especially when she is pregnant, so that her child
will enjoy the qualities (and paternal care) not merely of the best hunter,
but also of the best storyteller, the strongest warrior and the most
considerate lover. If this sounds silly, bear in mind that before the
development of modern embryological studies, people had no solid
evidence that babies are always sired by a single father rather than by
many.
The proponents of this ‘ancient commune’ theory argue that the
frequent infidelities that characterise modern marriages, and the high
rates of divorce, not to mention the cornucopia of psychological
complexes from which both children and adults suffer, all result from
forcing humans to live in nuclear families and monogamous
relationships that are incompatible with our biological software.1
Many scholars vehemently reject this theory, insisting that both
monogamy and the forming of nuclear families are core human
behaviours. Though ancient hunter-gatherer societies tended to be more
communal and egalitarian than modern societies, these researchers
argue, they were nevertheless comprised of separate cells, each
containing a jealous couple and the children they held in common. This
is why today monogamous relationships and nuclear families are the
norm in the vast majority of cultures, why men and women tend to be
very possessive of their partners and children, and why even in modern
states such as North Korea and Syria political authority passes from
father to son.
In order to resolve this controversy and understand our sexuality,
society and politics, we need to learn something about the living
conditions of our ancestors, to examine how Sapiens lived between the
Cognitive Revolution of 70,000 years ago, and the start of the
Agricultural Revolution about 12,000 years ago.
Unfortunately, there are few certainties regarding the lives of our forager
ancestors. The debate between the ‘ancient commune’ and ‘eternal
monogamy schools is based on flimsy evidence. We obviously have no
written records from the age of foragers, and the archaeological evidence
consists mainly of fossilised bones and stone tools. Artefacts made of
more perishable materials – such as wood, bamboo or leather – survive
only under unique conditions. The common impression that preagricultural humans lived in an age of stone is a misconception based on
this archaeological bias. The Stone Age should more accurately be called
the Wood Age, because most of the tools used by ancient huntergatherers were made of wood.
Any reconstruction of the lives of ancient hunter-gatherers from the
surviving artefacts is extremely problematic. One of the most glaring
differences between the ancient foragers and their agricultural and
industrial descendants is that foragers had very few artefacts to begin
with, and these played a comparatively modest role in their lives. Over
the course of his or her life, a typical member of a modern affluent
society will own several million artefacts – from cars and houses to
disposable nappies and milk cartons. There’s hardly an activity, a belief,
or even an emotion that is not mediated by objects of our own devising.
Our eating habits are mediated by a mind-boggling collection of such
items, from spoons and glasses to genetic engineering labs and gigantic
ocean-going ships. In play, we use a plethora of toys, from plastic cards
to 100,000-seater stadiums. Our romantic and sexual relations are
accoutred by rings, beds, nice clothes, sexy underwear, condoms,
fashionable restaurants, cheap motels, airport lounges, wedding halls
and catering companies. Religions bring the sacred into our lives with
Gothic churches, Muslim mosques, Hindu ashrams, Torah scrolls,
Tibetan prayer wheels, priestly cassocks, candles, incense, Christmas
trees, matzah balls, tombstones and icons.
We hardly notice how ubiquitous our stuff is until we have to move it
to a new house. Foragers moved house every month, every week, and
sometimes even every day, toting whatever they had on their backs.
There were no moving companies, wagons, or even pack animals to
share the burden. They consequently had to make do with only the most
essential possessions. It’s reasonable to presume, then, that the greater
part of their mental, religious and emotional lives was conducted
without the help of artefacts. An archaeologist working 100,000 years
from now could piece together a reasonable picture of Muslim belief and
practice from the myriad objects he unearthed in a ruined mosque. But
we are largely at a loss in trying to comprehend the beliefs and rituals of
ancient hunter-gatherers. It’s much the same dilemma that a future
historian would face if he had to depict the social world of twenty-firstcentury teenagers solely on the basis of their surviving snail mail – since
no records will remain of their phone conversations, emails, blogs and
text messages.
A reliance on artefacts will thus bias an account of ancient huntergatherer life. One way to remedy this is to look at modern forager
societies. These can be studied directly, by anthropological observation.
But there are good reasons to be very careful in extrapolating from
modern forager societies to ancient ones.
Firstly, all forager societies that have survived into the modern era
have been influenced by neighbouring agricultural and industrial
societies. Consequently, it’s risky to assume that what is true of them
was also true tens of thousands of years ago.
Secondly, modern forager societies have survived mainly in areas with
difficult climatic conditions and inhospitable terrain, ill-suited for
agriculture. Societies that have adapted to the extreme conditions of
places such as the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa may well provide a
very misleading model for understanding ancient societies in fertile
areas such as the Yangtze River Valley. In particular, population density
in an area like the Kalahari Desert is far lower than it was around the
ancient Yangtze, and this has far-reaching implications for key questions
about the size and structure of human bands and the relations between
them.
Thirdly, the most notable characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies is
how different they are one from the other. They differ not only from one
part of the world to another but even in the same region. One good
example is the huge variety the first European settlers found among the
Aborigine peoples of Australia. Just before the British conquest, between
300,000 and 700,000 hunter-gatherers lived on the continent in 200–
600 tribes, each of which was further divided into several bands.2 Each
tribe had its own language, religion, norms and customs. Living around
what is now Adelaide in southern Australia were several patrilineal clans
that reckoned descent from the father’s side. These clans bonded
together into tribes on a strictly territorial basis. In contrast, some tribes
in northern Australia gave more importance to a person’s maternal
ancestry, and a person’s tribal identity depended on his or her totem
rather than his territory.
It stands to reason that the ethnic and cultural variety among ancient
hunter-gatherers was equally impressive, and that the 5 million to 8
million foragers who populated the world on the eve of the Agricultural
Revolution were divided into thousands of separate tribes with
thousands of different languages and cultures.3 This, after all, was one of
the main legacies of the Cognitive Revolution. Thanks to the appearance
of fiction, even people with the same genetic make-up who lived under
similar ecological conditions were able to create very different imagined
realities, which manifested themselves in different norms and values.
For example, there’s every reason to believe that a forager band that
lived 30,000 years ago on the spot where Oxford University now stands
would have spoken a different language from one living where
Cambridge is now situated. One band might have been belligerent and
the other peaceful. Perhaps the Cambridge band was communal while
the one at Oxford was based on nuclear families. The Cantabrigians
might have spent long hours carving wooden statues of their guardian
spirits, whereas the Oxonians may have worshipped through dance. The
former perhaps believed in reincarnation, while the latter thought this
was nonsense. In one society, homosexual relationships might have been
accepted, while in the other they were taboo.
In other words, while anthropological observations of modern foragers
can help us understand some of the possibilities available to ancient
foragers, the ancient horizon of possibilities was much broader, and
most of it is hidden from our view.* The heated debates about Homo
sapiens’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point. Ever since the
Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for
Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering
palette of possibilities.
The Original Affluent Society
What generalisations can we make about life in the pre-agricultural
world nevertheless? It seems safe to say that the vast majority of people
lived in small bands numbering several dozen or at most several hundred
individuals, and that all these individuals were humans. It is important
to note this last point, because it is far from obvious. Most members of
agricultural and industrial societies are domesticated animals. They are
not equal to their masters, of course, but they are members all the same.
Today, the society called New Zealand is composed of 4.5 million
Sapiens and 50 million sheep.
There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog
was the first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred
before the Agricultural Revolution. Experts disagree about the exact date,
but we have incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about
15,000 years ago. They may have joined the human pack thousands of
years earlier.
Dogs were used for hunting and fighting, and as an alarm system
against wild beasts and human intruders. With the passing of
generations, the two species co-evolved to communicate well with each
other. Dogs that were most attentive to the needs and feelings of their
human companions got extra care and food, and were more likely to
survive. Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their
own needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper
understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between
humans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead dogs were even
buried ceremoniously, much like humans.
Members of a band knew each other very intimately, and were
surrounded throughout their lives by friends and relatives. Loneliness
and privacy were rare. Neighbouring bands probably competed for
resources and even fought one another, but they also had friendly
contacts. They exchanged members, hunted together, traded rare
luxuries, cemented political alliances and celebrated religious festivals.
Such cooperation was one of the important trademarks of Homo sapiens,
and gave it a crucial edge over other human species. Sometimes relations
with neighbouring bands were tight enough that together they
constituted a single tribe, sharing a common language, common myths,
and common norms and values.
Yet we should not overestimate the importance of such external
relations. Even if in times of crisis neighbouring bands drew closer
together, and even if they occasionally gathered to hunt or feast
together, they still spent the vast majority of their time in complete
isolation and independence. Trade was mostly limited to prestige items
such as shells, amber and pigments. There is no evidence that people
traded staple goods like fruits and meat, or that the existence of one
band depended on the importing of goods from another. Sociopolitical
relations, too, tended to be sporadic. The tribe did not serve as a
permanent political framework, and even if it had seasonal meeting
places, there were no permanent towns or institutions. The average
person lived many months without seeing or hearing a human from
outside of her own band, and she encountered throughout her life no
more than a few hundred humans. The Sapiens population was thinly
spread over vast territories. Before the Agricultural Revolution, the
human population of the entire planet was smaller than that of today’s
Cairo.
7. First pet? A 12,000-year-old tomb found in northern Israel. It contains the skeleton of a
fifty-year-old woman next to that of a puppy (bottom left corner). The puppy was buried
close to the woman’s head. Her left hand is resting on the dog in a way that might indicate
an emotional connection. There are, of course, other possible explanations. Perhaps, for
example, the puppy was a gift to the gatekeeper of the next world.
Most Sapiens bands lived on the road, roaming from place to place in
search of food. Their movements were influenced by the changing
seasons, the annual migrations of animals and the growth cycles of
plants. They usually travelled back and forth across the same home
territory, an area of between several dozen and many hundreds of square
kilometres.
Occasionally, bands wandered outside their turf and explored new
lands, whether due to natural calamities, violent conflicts, demographic
pressures or the initiative of a charismatic leader. These wanderings
were the engine of human worldwide expansion. If a forager band split
once every forty years and its splinter group migrated to a new territory
a hundred kilometres to the east, the distance from East Africa to China
would have been covered in about 10,000 years.
In some exceptional cases, when food sources were particularly rich,
bands settled down in seasonal and even permanent camps. Techniques
for drying, smoking and freezing food also made it possible to stay put
for longer periods. Most importantly, alongside seas and rivers rich in
seafood and waterfowl, humans set up permanent fishing villages – the
first permanent settlements in history, long predating the Agricultural
Revolution. Fishing villages might have appeared on the coasts of
Indonesian islands as early as 45,000 years ago. These may have been
the base from which Homo sapiens launched its first transoceanic
enterprise: the invasion of Australia.
In most habitats, Sapiens bands fed themselves in an elastic and
opportunistic fashion. They scrounged for termites, picked berries, dug
for roots, stalked rabbits and hunted bison and mammoth.
Notwithstanding the popular image of ‘man the hunter’, gathering was
Sapiens’ main activity, and it provided most of their calories, as well as
raw materials such as flint, wood and bamboo.
Sapiens did not forage only for food and materials. They foraged for
knowledge as well. To survive, they needed a detailed mental map of
their territory. To maximise the efficiency of their daily search for food,
they required information about the growth patterns of each plant and
the habits of each animal. They needed to know which foods were
nourishing, which made you sick, and how to use others as cures. They
needed to know the progress of the seasons and what warning signs
preceded a thunderstorm or a dry spell. They studied every stream,
every walnut tree, every bear cave, and every flint-stone deposit in their
vicinity. Each individual had to understand how to make a stone knife,
how to mend a torn cloak, how to lay a rabbit trap, and how to face
avalanches, snakebites or hungry lions. Mastery of each of these many
skills required years of apprenticeship and practice. The average ancient
forager could turn a flint stone into a spear point within minutes. When
we try to imitate this feat, we usually fail miserably. Most of us lack
expert knowledge of the flaking properties of flint and basalt and the
fine motor skills needed to work them precisely.
In other words, the average forager had wider, deeper and more
varied knowledge of her immediate surroundings than most of her
modern descendants. Today, most people in industrial societies don’t
need to know much about the natural world in order to survive. What do
you really need to know in order to get by as a computer engineer, an
insurance agent, a history teacher or a factory worker? You need to
know a lot about your own tiny field of expertise, but for the vast
majority of life’s necessities you rely blindly on the help of other experts,
whose own knowledge is also limited to a tiny field of expertise. The
human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But
at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable
and skilful people in history.
There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has
actually decreased since the age of foraging.5 Survival in that era
required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and
industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others
for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could
survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by
working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker.
Foragers mastered not only the surrounding world of animals, plants
and objects, but also the internal world of their own bodies and senses.
They listened to the slightest movement in the grass to learn whether a
snake might be lurking there. They carefully observed the foliage of trees
in order to discover fruits, beehives and bird nests. They moved with a
minimum of effort and noise, and knew how to sit, walk and run in the
most agile and efficient manner. Varied and constant use of their bodies
made them as fit as marathon runners. They had physical dexterity that
people today are unable to achieve even after years of practising yoga or
t’ai chi.
The hunter-gatherer way of life differed significantly from region to
region and from season to season, but on the whole foragers seem to
have enjoyed a more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of
the peasants, shepherds, labourers and office clerks who followed in
their footsteps.
While people in today’s affluent societies work an average of forty to
forty-five hours a week, and people in the developing world work sixty
and even eighty hours a week, hunter-gatherers living today in the most
inhospitable of habitats – such as the Kalahari Desert work on average
for just thirty-five to forty-five hours a week. They hunt only one day out
of three, and gathering takes up just three to six hours daily. In normal
times, this is enough to feed the band. It may well be that ancient
hunter-gatherers living in zones more fertile than the Kalahari spent
even less time obtaining food and raw materials. On top of that, foragers
enjoyed a lighter load of household chores. They had no dishes to wash,
no carpets to vacuum, no floors to polish, no nappies to change and no
bills to pay.
The forager economy provided most people with more interesting lives
than agriculture or industry do. Today, a Chinese factory hand leaves
home around seven in the morning, makes her way through polluted
streets to a sweatshop, and there operates the same machine, in the same
way, day in, day out, for ten long and mind-numbing hours, returning
home around seven in the evening in order to wash dishes and do the
laundry. Thirty thousand years ago, a Chinese forager might leave camp
with her companions at, say, eight in the morning. They’d roam the
nearby forests and meadows, gathering mushrooms, digging up edible
roots, catching frogs and occasionally running away from tigers. By early
afternoon, they were back at the camp to make lunch. That left them
plenty of time to gossip, tell stories, play with the children and just hang
out. Of course the tigers sometimes caught them, or a snake bit them,
but on the other hand they didn’t have to deal with automobile
accidents and industrial pollution.
In most places and at most times, foraging provided ideal nutrition.
That is hardly surprising – this had been the human diet for hundreds of
thousands of years, and the human body was well adapted to it.
Evidence from fossilised skeletons indicates that ancient foragers were
less likely to suffer from starvation or malnutrition, and were generally
taller and healthier than their peasant descendants. Average life
expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this was due
largely to the high incidence of child mortality. Children who made it
through the perilous first years had a good chance of reaching the age of
sixty, and some even made it to their eighties. Among modern foragers,
forty-five-year-old women can expect to live another twenty years, and
about 5–8 per cent of the population is over sixty.6
The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation
and malnutrition, was their varied diet. Farmers tend to eat a very
limited and unbalanced diet. Especially in premodern times, most of the
calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop –
such as wheat, potatoes or rice – that lacks some of the vitamins,
minerals and other nutritional materials humans need. The typical
peasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and
rice for dinner. If she were lucky, she could expect to eat the same on
the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of
different foodstuffs. The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may
have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits, snails and turtle
for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrows
menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that
the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients.
Furthermore, by not being dependent on any single kind of food, they
were less liable to suffer when one particular food source failed.
Agricultural societies are ravaged by famine when drought, fire or
earthquake devastates the annual rice or potato crop. Forager societies
were hardly immune to natural disasters, and suffered from periods of
want and hunger, but they were usually able to deal with such
calamities more easily. If they lost some of their staple foodstuffs, they
could gather or hunt other species, or move to a less affected area.
Ancient foragers also suffered less from infectious diseases. Most of the
infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies
(such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated
animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural
Revolution. Ancient foragers, who had domesticated only dogs, were free
of these scourges. Moreover, most people in agricultural and industrial
societies lived in dense, unhygienic permanent settlements – ideal
hotbeds for disease. Foragers roamed the land in small bands that could
not sustain epidemics.
The wholesome and varied diet, the relatively short working week, and
the rarity of infectious diseases have led many experts to define preagricultural forager societies as ‘the original affluent societies’. It would
be a mistake, however, to idealise the lives of these ancients. Though
they lived better lives than most people in agricultural and industrial
societies, their world could still be harsh and unforgiving. Periods of
want and hardship were not uncommon, child mortality was high, and
an accident which would be minor today could easily become a death
sentence. Most people probably enjoyed the close intimacy of the
roaming band, but those unfortunates who incurred the hostility or
mockery of their fellow band members probably suffered terribly.
Modern foragers occasionally abandon and even kill old or disabled
people who cannot keep up with the band. Unwanted babies and
children may be slain, and there are even cases of religiously inspired
human sacrifice.
The Aché people, hunter-gatherers who lived in the jungles of
Paraguay until the 1960s, offer a glimpse into the darker side of
foraging. When a valued band member died, the Aché customarily killed
a little girl and buried the two together. Anthropologists who
interviewed the Aché recorded a case in which a band abandoned a
middle-aged man who fell sick and was unable to keep up with the
others. He was left under a tree. Vultures perched above him, expecting
a hearty meal. But the man recuperated, and, walking briskly, he
managed to rejoin the band. His body was covered with the birds’ faeces,
so he was henceforth nicknamed ‘Vulture Droppings’.
When an old Aché woman became a burden to the rest of the band,
one of the younger men would sneak behind her and kill her with an
axe-blow to the head. An Aché man told the inquisitive anthropologists
stories of his prime years in the jungle. ‘I customarily killed old women.
I used to kill my aunts … The women were afraid of me … Now, here
with the whites, I have become weak.’ Babies born without hair, who
were considered underdeveloped, were killed immediately. One woman
recalled that her first baby girl was killed because the men in the band
did not want another girl. On another occasion a man killed a small boy
because he was ‘in a bad mood and the child was crying’. Another child
was buried alive because ‘it was funny-looking and the other children
laughed at it’.7
We should be careful, though, not to judge the Aché too quickly.
Anthropologists who lived with them for years report that violence
between adults was very rare. Both women and men were free to change
partners at will. They smiled and laughed constantly, had no leadership
hierarchy, and generally shunned domineering people. They were
extremely generous with their few possessions, and were not obsessed
with success or wealth. The things they valued most in life were good
social interactions and high-quality friendships.8 They viewed the killing
of children, sick people and the elderly as many people today view
abortion and euthanasia. It should also be noted that the Aché were
hunted and killed without mercy by Paraguayan farmers. The need to
evade their enemies probably caused the Aché to adopt an exceptionally
harsh attitude towards anyone who might become a liability to the band.
The truth is that Aché society, like every human society, was very
complex. We should beware of demonising or idealising it on the basis of
a superficial acquaintance. The Aché were neither angels nor fiends –
they were humans. So, too, were the ancient hunter-gatherers.
