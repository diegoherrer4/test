Talking Ghosts
What can we say about the spiritual and mental life of the ancient
hunter-gatherers? The basics of the forager economy can be
reconstructed with some confidence based on quantifiable and objective
factors. For example, we can calculate how many calories per day a
person needed in order to survive, how many calories were obtained
from a kilogram of walnuts, and how many walnuts could be gathered
from a square kilometre of forest. With this data, we can make an
educated guess about the relative importance of walnuts in their diet.
But did they consider walnuts a delicacy or a humdrum staple? Did
they believe that walnut trees were inhabited by spirits? Did they find
walnut leaves pretty? If a forager boy wanted to take a forager girl to a
romantic spot, did the shade of a walnut tree suffice? The world of
thought, belief and feeling is by definition far more difficult to decipher.
Most scholars agree that animistic beliefs were common among
ancient foragers. Animism (from ‘anima’, ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the
belief that almost every place, every animal, every plant and every
natural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate
directly with humans. Thus, animists may believe that the big rock at the
top of the hill has desires and needs. The rock might be angry about
something that people did and rejoice over some other action. The rock
might admonish people or ask for favours. Humans, for their part, can
address the rock, to mollify or threaten it. Not only the rock, but also the
oak tree at the bottom of the hill is an animated being, and so is the
stream flowing below the hill, the spring in the forest clearing, the
bushes growing around it, the path to the clearing, and the field mice,
wolves and crows that drink there. In the animist world, objects and
living things are not the only animated beings. There are also immaterial
entities – the spirits of the dead, and friendly and malevolent beings, the
kind that we today call demons, fairies and angels.
Animists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other
beings. They can all communicate directly through speech, song, dance
and ceremony. A hunter may address a herd of deer and ask that one of
them sacrifice itself. If the hunt succeeds, the hunter may ask the dead
animal to forgive him. When someone falls sick, a shaman can contact
the spirit that caused the sickness and try to pacify it or scare it away. If
need be, the shaman may ask for help from other spirits. What
characterises all these acts of communication is that the entities being
addressed are local beings. They are not universal gods, but rather a
particular deer, a particular tree, a particular stream, a particular ghost.
Just as there is no barrier between humans and other beings, neither is
there a strict hierarchy. Non-human entities do not exist merely to
provide for the needs of man. Nor are they all-powerful gods who run
the world as they wish. The world does not revolve around humans or
around any other particular group of beings.
Animism is not a specific religion. It is a generic name for thousands
of very different religions, cults and beliefs. What makes all of them
‘animist’ is this common approach to the world and to man’s place in it.
Saying that ancient foragers were probably animists is like saying that
premodern agriculturists were mostly theists. Theism (from ‘theos’, ‘god’
in Greek) is the view that the universal order is based on a hierarchical
relationship between humans and a small group of ethereal entities
called gods. It is certainly true to say that premodern agriculturists
tended to be theists, but it does not teach us much about the particulars.
The generic rubric ‘theists’ covers Jewish rabbis from eighteenth-century
Poland, witch-burning Puritans from seventeenth-century Massachusetts,
Aztec priests from fifteenth-century Mexico, Sufi mystics from twelfthcentury Iran, tenth-century Viking warriors, second-century Roman
legionnaires, and first-century Chinese bureaucrats. Each of these viewed
the others’ beliefs and practices as weird and heretical. The differences
between the beliefs and practices of groups of ‘animistic’ foragers were
probably just as big. Their religious experience may have been turbulent
and filled with controversies, reforms and revolutions.
But these cautious generalisations are about as far as we can go. Any
attempt to describe the specifics of archaic spirituality is highly
speculative, as there is next to no evidence to go by and the little
evidence we have – a handful of artefacts and cave paintings – can be
interpreted in myriad ways. The theories of scholars who claim to know
what the foragers felt shed much more light on the prejudices of their
authors than on Stone Age religions.
Instead of erecting mountains of theory over a molehill of tomb relics,
cave paintings and bone statuettes, it is better to be frank and admit that
we have only the haziest notions about the religions of ancient foragers.
We assume that they were animists, but that’s not very informative. We
don’t know which spirits they prayed to, which festivals they celebrated,
or which taboos they observed. Most importantly, we don’t know what
stories they told. It’s one of the biggest holes in our understanding of
human history.
The sociopolitical world of the foragers is another area about which we
know next to nothing. As explained above, scholars cannot even agree
on the basics, such as the existence of private property, nuclear families
and monogamous relationships. It’s likely that different bands had
different structures. Some may have been as hierarchical, tense and
violent as the nastiest chimpanzee group, while others were as laid-back,
peaceful and lascivious as a bunch of bonobos.
8. A painting from Lascaux Cave, c.15,000–20,000 years ago. What exactly do we see, and
what is the painting’s meaning? Some argue that we see a man with the head of a bird and
an erect penis, being killed by a bison. Beneath the man is another bird which might
symbolise the soul, released from the body at the moment of death. If so, the picture
depicts not a prosaic hunting accident, but rather the passage from this world to the next.
But we have no way of knowing whether any of these speculations are true. It’s a
Rorschach test that reveals much about the preconceptions of modern scholars, and little
about the beliefs of ancient foragers.
In Sungir, Russia, archaeologists discovered in 1955 a 30,000-year-old
burial site belonging to a mammoth-hunting culture. In one grave they
found the skeleton of a fifty-year-old man, covered with strings of
mammoth ivory beads, containing about 3,000 beads in total. On the
dead man’s head was a hat decorated with fox teeth, and on his wrists
twenty-five ivory bracelets. Other graves from the same site contained
far fewer goods. Scholars deduced that the Sungir mammoth-hunters
lived in a hierarchical society, and that the dead man was perhaps the
leader of a band or of an entire tribe comprising several bands. It is
unlikely that a few dozen members of a single band could have produced
so many grave goods by themselves.
9. Hunter-gatherers made these handprints about 9,000 years ago in the ‘Hands Cave’, in
Argentina. It looks as if these long-dead hands are reaching towards us from within the
rock. This is one of the most moving relics of the ancient forager world – but nobody
knows what it means.
Archaeologists then discovered an even more interesting tomb. It
contained two skeletons, buried head to head. One belonged to a boy
aged about twelve or thirteen, and the other to a girl of about nine or
ten. The boy was covered with 5,000 ivory beads. He wore a fox-tooth
hat and a belt with 250 fox teeth (at least sixty foxes had to have their
teeth pulled to get that many). The girl was adorned with 5,250 ivory
beads. Both children were surrounded by statuettes and various ivory
objects. A skilled craftsman (or craftswoman) probably needed about
forty-five minutes to prepare a single ivory bead. In other words,
fashioning the 10,000 ivory beads that covered the two children, not to
mention the other objects, required some 7,500 hours of delicate work,
well over three years of labour by an experienced artisan!
It is highly unlikely that at such a young age the Sungir children had
proved themselves as leaders or mammoth-hunters. Only cultural beliefs
can explain why they received such an extravagant burial. One theory is
that they owed their rank to their parents. Perhaps they were the
children of the leader, in a culture that believed in either family
charisma or strict rules of succession. According to a second theory, the
children had been identified at birth as the incarnations of some longdead spirits. A third theory argues that the children’s burial reflects the
way they died rather than their status in life. They were ritually
sacrificed – perhaps as part of the burial rites of the leader – and then
entombed with pomp and circumstance.9
Whatever the correct answer, the Sungir children are among the best
pieces of evidence that 30,000 years ago Sapiens could invent
sociopolitical codes that went far beyond the dictates of our DNA and
the behaviour patterns of other human and animal species.
Peace or War?
Finally, there’s the thorny question of the role of war in forager societies.
Some scholars imagine ancient hunter-gatherer societies as peaceful
paradises, and argue that war and violence began only with the
Agricultural Revolution, when people started to accumulate private
property. Other scholars maintain that the world of the ancient foragers
was exceptionally cruel and violent. Both schools of thought are castles
in the air, connected to the ground by the thin strings of meagre
archaeological remains and anthropological observations of present-day
foragers.
The anthropological evidence is intriguing but very problematic.
Foragers today live mainly in isolated and inhospitable areas such as the
Arctic or the Kalahari, where population density is very low and
opportunities to fight other people are limited. Moreover, in recent
generations, foragers have been increasingly subject to the authority of
modern states, which prevent the eruption of large-scale conflicts.
European scholars have had only two opportunities to observe large and
relatively dense populations of independent foragers: in north-western
North America in the nineteenth century, and in northern Australia
during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Both Amerindian
and Aboriginal Australian cultures witnessed frequent armed conflicts. It
is debatable, however, whether this represents a ‘timeless’ condition or
the impact of European imperialism.
The archaeological findings are both scarce and opaque. What telltale
clues might remain of any war that took place tens of thousands of years
ago? There were no fortifications and walls back then, no artillery shells
or even swords and shields. An ancient spear point might have been used
in war, but it could have been used in a hunt as well. Fossilised human
bones are no less hard to interpret. A fracture might indicate a war
wound or an accident. Nor is the absence of fractures and cuts on an
ancient skeleton conclusive proof that the person to whom the skeleton
belonged did not die a violent death. Death can be caused by trauma to
soft tissues that leaves no marks on bone. Even more importantly, during
pre-industrial warfare more than 90 per cent of war dead were killed by
starvation, cold and disease rather than by weapons. Imagine that
30,000 years ago one tribe defeated its neighbour and expelled it from
coveted foraging grounds. In the decisive battle, ten members of the
defeated tribe were killed. In the following year, another hundred
members of the losing tribe died from starvation, cold and disease.
Archaeologists who come across these no skeletons may too easily
conclude that most fell victim to some natural disaster. How would we
be able to tell that they were all victims of a merciless war?
Duly warned, we can now turn to the archaeological findings. In
Portugal, a survey was made of 400 skeletons from the period
immediately predating the Agricultural Revolution. Only two skeletons
showed clear marks of violence. A similar survey of 400 skeletons from
the same period in Israel discovered a single crack in a single skull that
could be attributed to human violence. A third survey of 400 skeletons
from various pre-agricultural sites in the Danube Valley found evidence
of violence on eighteen skeletons. Eighteen out of 400 may not sound
like a lot, but it’s actually a very high percentage. If all eighteen indeed
died violently, it means that about 4.5 per cent of deaths in the ancient
Danube Valley were caused by human violence. Today, the global
average is only 1.5 per cent, taking war and crime together. During the
twentieth century, only 5 per cent of human deaths resulted from human
violence – and this in a century that saw the bloodiest wars and most
massive genocides in history. If this revelation is typical, the ancient
Danube Valley was as violent as the twentieth century.*
The depressing findings from the Danube Valley are supported by a
string of equally depressing findings from other areas. At Jabl Sahaba in
Sudan, a 12,000-year-old cemetery containing fifty-nine skeletons was
discovered. Arrowheads and spear points were found embedded in or
lying near the bones of twenty-four skeletons, 40 per cent of the find.
The skeleton of one woman revealed twelve injuries. In Ofnet Cave in
Bavaria, archaeologists discovered the remains of thirty-eight foragers,
mainly women and children, who had been thrown into two burial pits.
Half the skeletons, including those of children and babies, bore clear
signs of damage by human weapons such as clubs and knives. The few
skeletons belonging to mature males bore the worst marks of violence. In
all probability, an entire forager band was massacred at Ofnet.
Which better represents the world of the ancient foragers: the peaceful
skeletons from Israel and Portugal, or the abattoirs of Jabl Sahaba and
Ofnet? The answer is neither. Just as foragers exhibited a wide array of
religions and social structures, so, too, did they probably demonstrate a
variety of violence rates. While some areas and some periods of time
may have enjoyed peace and tranquillity, others were riven by ferocious
conflicts.10
The Curtain of Silence
If the larger picture of ancient forager life is hard to reconstruct,
particular events are largely irretrievable. When a Sapiens band first
entered a valley inhabited by Neanderthals, the following years might
have witnessed a breathtaking historical drama. Unfortunately, nothing
would have survived from such an encounter except, at best, a few
fossilised bones and a handful of stone tools that remain mute under the
most intense scholarly inquisitions. We may extract from them
information about human anatomy, human technology, human diet, and
perhaps even human social structure. But they reveal nothing about the
political alliance forged between neighbouring Sapiens bands, about the
spirits of the dead that blessed this alliance, or about the ivory beads
secretly given to the local witch doctor in order to secure the blessing of
the spirits.
This curtain of silence shrouds tens of thousands of years of history.
These long millennia may well have witnessed wars and revolutions,
ecstatic religious movements, profound philosophical theories,
incomparable artistic masterpieces. The foragers may have had their allconquering Napoleons, who ruled empires half the size of Luxembourg;
gifted Beethovens who lacked symphony orchestras but brought people
to tears with the sound of their bamboo flutes; and charismatic prophets
who revealed the words of a local oak tree rather than those of a
universal creator god. But these are all mere guesses. The curtain of
silence is so thick that we cannot even be sure such things occurred – let
alone describe them in detail.
Scholars tend to ask only those questions that they can reasonably
expect to answer. Without the discovery of as yet unavailable research
tools, we will probably never know what the ancient foragers believed or
what political dramas they experienced. Yet it is vital to ask questions
for which no answers are available, otherwise we might be tempted to
dismiss 60,000 of 70,000 years of human history with the excuse that
‘the people who lived back then did nothing of importance’.
The truth is that they did a lot of important things. In particular, they
shaped the world around us to a much larger degree than most people
realise. Trekkers visiting the Siberian tundra, the deserts of central
Australia and the Amazonian rainforest believe that they have entered
pristine landscapes, virtually untouched by human hands. But that’s an
illusion. The foragers were there before us and they brought about
dramatic changes even in the densest jungles and the most desolate
wildernesses. The next chapter explains how the foragers completely
reshaped the ecology of our planet long before the first agricultural
village was built. The wandering bands of storytelling Sapiens were the
most important and most destructive force the animal kingdom had ever
produced.
* A ‘horizon of possibilities’ means the entire spectrum of beliefs, practices and experiences that
are open before a particular society, given its ecological, technological and cultural limitations.
Each society and each individual usually explore only a tiny fraction of their horizon of
possibilities.
* It might be argued that not all eighteen ancient Danubians actually died from the violence
whose marks can be seen on their remains. Some were only injured. However, this is probably
counterbalanced by deaths from trauma to soft tissues and from the invisible deprivations that
accompany war.

The Flood
PRIOR TO THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION, humans of all species lived
exclusively on the Afro-Asian landmass. True, they had settled a few
islands by swimming short stretches of water or crossing them on
improvised rafts. Flores, for example, was colonised as far back as
850,000 years ago. Yet they were unable to venture into the open sea,
and none reached America, Australia, or remote islands such as
Madagascar, New Zealand and Hawaii.
The sea barrier prevented not just humans but also many other AfroAsian animals and plants from reaching this ‘Outer World’. As a result,
the organisms of distant lands like Australia and Madagascar evolved in
isolation for millions upon millions of years, taking on shapes and
natures very different from those of their distant Afro-Asian relatives.
Planet Earth was separated into several distinct ecosystems, each made
up of a unique assembly of animals and plants. Homo sapiens was about
to put an end to this biological exuberance.
Following the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens acquired the technology,
the organisational skills, and perhaps even the vision necessary to break
out of Afro-Asia and settle the Outer World. Their first achievement was
the colonisation of Australia some 45,000 years ago. Experts are hardpressed to explain this feat. In order to reach Australia, humans had to
cross a number of sea channels, some more than a hundred kilometres
wide, and upon arrival they had to adapt nearly overnight to a
completely new ecosystem.
The most reasonable theory suggests that, about 45,000 years ago, the
Sapiens living in the Indonesian archipelago (a group of islands
separated from Asia and from each other by only narrow straits)
developed the first seafaring societies. They learned how to build and
manoeuvre ocean-going vessels and became long-distance fishermen,
traders and explorers. This would have brought about an unprecedented
transformation in human capabilities and lifestyles. Every other mammal
that went to sea – seals, sea cows, dolphins – had to evolve for aeons to
develop specialised organs and a hydrodynamic body. The Sapiens in
Indonesia, descendants of apes who lived on the African savannah,
became Pacific seafarers without growing flippers and without having to
wait for their noses to migrate to the top of their heads as whales did.
Instead, they built boats and learned how to steer them. And these skills
enabled them to reach and settle Australia.
True, archaeologists have yet to unearth rafts, oars or fishing villages
that date back as far as 45,000 years ago (they would be difficult to
discover, because rising sea levels have buried the ancient Indonesian
shoreline under a hundred metres of ocean). Nevertheless, there is strong
circumstantial evidence to support this theory, especially the fact that in
the thousands of years following the settlement of Australia, Sapiens
colonised a large number of small and isolated islands to its north. Some,
such as Buka and Manus, were separated from the closest land by 200
kilometres of open water. It’s hard to believe that anyone could have
reached and colonised Manus without sophisticated vessels and sailing
skills. As mentioned earlier, there is also firm evidence for regular sea
trade between some of these islands, such as New Ireland and New
Britain.1
The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most
important events in history, at least as important as Columbus’ journey
to America or the Apollo 11 expedition to the moon. It was the first time
any human had managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system –
indeed, the first time any large terrestrial mammal had managed to cross
from Afro-Asia to Australia. Of even greater importance was what the
human pioneers did in this new world. The moment the first huntergatherer set foot on an Australian beach was the moment that Homo
sapiens climbed to the top rung in the food chain on a particular
landmass and thereafter became the deadliest species in the annals of
planet Earth.
Up until then humans had displayed some innovative adaptations and
behaviours, but their effect on their environment had been negligible.
They had demonstrated remarkable success in moving into and adjusting
to various habitats, but they did so without drastically changing those
habitats. The settlers of Australia, or more accurately, its conquerors,
didn’t just adapt, they transformed the Australian ecosystem beyond
recognition.
The first human footprint on a sandy Australian beach was
immediately washed away by the waves. Yet when the invaders
advanced inland, they left behind a different footprint, one that would
never be expunged. As they pushed on, they encountered a strange
universe of unknown creatures that included a 200-kilogram, two-metre
kangaroo, and a marsupial lion, as massive as a modern tiger, that was
the continent’s largest predator. Koalas far too big to be cuddly and cute
rustled in the trees and flightless birds twice the size of ostriches
sprinted on the plains. Dragon-like lizards and snakes five metres long
slithered through the undergrowth. The giant diprotodon, a two-and-ahalf-ton wombat, roamed the forests. Except for the birds and reptiles,
all these animals were marsupials – like kangaroos, they gave birth to
tiny, helpless, fetus-like young which they then nurtured with milk in
abdominal pouches. Marsupial mammals were almost unknown in Africa
and Asia, but in Australia they reigned supreme.
Within a few thousand years, virtually all of these giants vanished. Of
the twenty-four Australian animal species weighing fifty kilograms or
more, twenty-three became extinct.2 A large number of smaller species
also disappeared. Food chains throughout the entire Australian
ecosystem were broken and rearranged. It was the most important
transformation of the Australian ecosystem for millions of years. Was it
all the fault of Homo sapiens?
Guilty as Charged
Some scholars try to exonerate our species, placing the blame on the
vagaries of the climate (the usual scapegoat in such cases). Yet it is hard
to believe that Homo sapiens was completely innocent. There are three
pieces of evidence that weaken the climate alibi, and implicate our
ancestors in the extinction of the Australian megafauna.
Firstly, even though Australia’s climate changed some 45,000 years
ago, it wasn’t a very remarkable upheaval. It’s hard to see how the new
weather patterns alone could have caused such a massive extinction. It’s
common today to explain anything and everything as the result of
climate change, but the truth is that earth’s climate never rests. It is in
constant flux. Every event in history occurred against the background of
some climate change.
In particular, our planet has experienced numerous cycles of cooling
and warming. During the last million years, there has been an ice age on
average every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to
15,000 years ago. Not unusually severe for an ice age, it had twin peaks,
the first about 70,000 years ago and the second at about 20,000 years
ago. The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million
years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages. It
also survived the first peak of the last ice age, around 70,000 years ago.
Why, then, did it disappear 45,000 years ago? Of course, if diprotodons
had been the only large animal to disappear at this time, it might have
been just a fluke. But more than 90 per cent of Australia’s megafauna
disappeared along with the diprotodon. The evidence is circumstantial,
but it’s hard to imagine that Sapiens, just by coincidence, arrived in
Australia at the precise point that all these animals were dropping dead
of the chills.3
Secondly, when climate change causes mass extinctions, sea creatures
are usually hit as hard as land dwellers. Yet there is no evidence of any
significant disappearance of oceanic fauna 45,000 years ago. Human
involvement can easily explain why the wave of extinction obliterated
the terrestrial megafauna of Australia while sparing that of the nearby
oceans. Despite its burgeoning navigational abilities, Homo sapiens was
still overwhelmingly a terrestrial menace.
Thirdly, mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation
occurred again and again in the ensuing millennia – whenever people
settled another part of the Outer World. In these cases Sapiens guilt is
irrefutable. For example, the megafauna of New Zealand – which had
weathered the alleged ‘climate change’ of c.45,000 years ago without a
scratch – suffered devastating blows immediately after the first humans
set foot on the islands. The Maoris, New Zealand’s first Sapiens
colonisers, reached the islands about 800 years ago. Within a couple of
centuries, the majority of the local megafauna was extinct, along with 60
per cent of all bird species.
A similar fate befell the mammoth population of Wrangel Island in the
Arctic Ocean (200 kilometres north of the Siberian coast). Mammoths
had flourished for millions of years over most of the northern
hemisphere, but as Homo sapiens spread – first over Eurasia and then
over North America – the mammoths retreated. By 10,000 years ago
there was not a single mammoth to be found in the world, except on a
few remote Arctic islands, most conspicuously Wrangel. The mammoths
of Wrangel continued to prosper for a few more millennia, then suddenly
disappeared about 4,000 years ago, just when the first humans reached
the island.
Were the Australian extinction an isolated event, we could grant
humans the benefit of the doubt. But the historical record makes Homo
sapiens look like an ecological serial killer.
All the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age
technology. How could they cause an ecological disaster? There are
three explanations that mesh quite nicely.
Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction –
breed slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and
there are long breaks between pregnancies. Consequently, if humans cut
down even one diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to
cause diprotodon deaths to outnumber births. Within a few thousand
years the last, lonesome diprotodon would pass away, and with her the
entire species.4
In fact, for all their size, diprotodons and Australia’s other giants
probably wouldn’t have been that hard to hunt because they would have
been taken totally by surprise by their two-legged assailants. Various
human species had been prowling and evolving in Afro-Asia for 2
million years. They slowly honed their hunting skills, and began going
after large animals around 400,000 years ago. The big beasts of Africa
and Asia learned to avoid humans, so when the new mega-predator –
Homo sapiens – appeared on the Afro-Asian scene, the large animals
already knew to keep their distance from creatures that looked like it. In
contrast, the Australian giants had no time to learn to run away. Humans
don’t come across as particularly dangerous. They don’t have long, sharp
teeth or muscular, lithe bodies. So when a diprotodon, the largest
marsupial ever to walk the earth, set eyes for the first time on this fraillooking ape, he gave it one glance and then went back to chewing
leaves. These animals had to evolve a fear of humankind, but before they
could do so they were gone.
The second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia,
they had already mastered fire agriculture. Faced with an alien and
threatening environment, they deliberately burned vast areas of
impassable thickets and dense forests to create open grasslands, which
attracted more easily hunted game, and were better suited to their
needs. They thereby completely changed the ecology of large parts of
Australia within a few short millennia.
One body of evidence supporting this view is the fossil plant record.
Eucalyptus trees were rare in Australia 45,000 years ago. But the arrival
of Homo sapiens inaugurated a golden age for the species. Since
eucalyptuses are particularly resistant to fire, they spread far and wide
while other trees and shrubs disappeared.
These changes in vegetation influenced the animals that ate the plants
and the carnivores that ate the vegetarians. Koalas, which subsist
exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, happily munched their way into new
territories. Most other animals suffered greatly. Many Australian food
chains collapsed, driving the weakest links into extinction.5
A third explanation agrees that hunting and fire agriculture played a
significant role in the extinction, but emphasises that we can’t
completely ignore the role of climate. The climate changes that beset
Australia about 45,000 years ago destabilised the ecosystem and made it
particularly vulnerable. Under normal circumstances the system would
probably have recuperated, as had happened many times previously.
However, humans appeared on the stage at just this critical juncture and
pushed the brittle ecosystem into the abyss. The combination of climate
change and human hunting is particularly devastating for large animals,
since it attacks them from different angles. It is hard to find a good
survival strategy that will work simultaneously against multiple threats.
Without further evidence, there’s no way of deciding between the
three scenarios. But there are certainly good reasons to believe that if
Homo sapiens had never gone Down Under, it would still be home to
marsupial lions, diprotodons and giant kangaroos.
The End of Sloth
The extinction of the Australian megafauna was probably the first
significant mark Homo sapiens left on our planet. It was followed by an
even larger ecological disaster, this time in America. Homo sapiens was
the first and only human species to reach the western hemisphere
landmass, arriving about 16,000 years ago, that is in or around 14,000
BC. The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at
the time, sea levels were low enough that a land bridge connected northeastern Siberia with north-western Alaska. Not that it was easy – the
journey was an arduous one, perhaps harder than the sea passage to
Australia. To make the crossing, Sapiens first had to learn how to
withstand the extreme Arctic conditions of northern Siberia, an area on
which the sun never shines in winter, and where temperatures can drop
to minus fifty degrees Celsius.
No previous human species had managed to penetrate places like
northern Siberia. Even the cold-adapted Neanderthals restricted
themselves to relatively warmer regions further south. But Homo sapiens,
whose body was adapted to living in the African savannah rather than in
the lands of snow and ice, devised ingenious solutions. When roaming
bands of Sapiens foragers migrated into colder climates, they learned to
make snowshoes and effective thermal clothing composed of layers of
furs and skins, sewn together tightly with the help of needles. They
developed new weapons and sophisticated hunting techniques that
enabled them to track and kill mammoths and the other big game of the
far north. As their thermal clothing and hunting techniques improved,
Sapiens dared to venture deeper and deeper into the frozen regions. And
as they moved north, their clothes, hunting strategies and other survival
skills continued to improve.
But why did they bother? Why banish oneself to Siberia by choice?
Perhaps some bands were driven north by wars, demographic pressures
or natural disasters. Others might have been lured northwards by more
positive reasons, such as animal protein. The Arctic lands were full of
large, juicy animals such as reindeer and mammoths. Every mammoth
was a source of a vast quantity of meat (which, given the frosty
temperatures, could even be frozen for later use), tasty fat, warm fur and
valuable ivory. As the findings from Sungir testify, mammoth-hunters
did not just survive in the frozen north – they thrived. As time passed,
the bands spread far and wide, pursuing mammoths, mastodons,
rhinoceroses and reindeer. Around 14,000 BC, the chase took some of
them from north-eastern Siberia to Alaska. Of course, they didn’t know
they were discovering a new world. For mammoth and man alike, Alaska
was a mere extension of Siberia.
At first, glaciers blocked the way from Alaska to the rest of America,
allowing no more than perhaps a few isolated pioneers to investigate the
lands further south. However, around 12,000 BC global warming melted
the ice and opened an easier passage. Making use of the new corridor,
people moved south en masse, spreading over the entire continent.
Though originally adapted to hunting large game in the Arctic, they soon
adjusted to an amazing variety of climates and ecosystems. Descendants
of the Siberians settled the thick forests of the eastern United States, the
swamps of the Mississippi Delta, the deserts of Mexico and steaming
jungles of Central America. Some made their homes in the river world of
the Amazon basin, others struck roots in Andean mountain valleys or the
open pampas of Argentina. And all this happened in a mere millennium
or two! By 10,000 BC, humans already inhabited the most southern point
in America, the island of Tierra del Fuego at the continent’s southern tip.
The human blitzkrieg across America testifies to the incomparable
ingenuity and the unsurpassed adaptability of Homo sapiens. No other
animal had ever moved into such a huge variety of radically different
habitats so quickly, everywhere using virtually the same genes.6
The settling of America was hardly bloodless. It left behind a long trail
of victims. American fauna 14,000 years ago was far richer than it is
today. When the first Americans marched south from Alaska into the
plains of Canada and the western United States, they encountered
mammoths and mastodons, rodents the size of bears, herds of horses and
camels, oversized lions and dozens of large species the likes of which are
completely unknown today, among them fearsome sabre-tooth cats and
giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons and reached a height
of six metres. South America hosted an even more exotic menagerie of
large mammals, reptiles and birds. The Americas were a great laboratory
of evolutionary experimentation, a place where animals and plants
unknown in Africa and Asia had evolved and thrived.
But no longer. Within 2,000 years of the Sapiens arrival, most of these
unique species were gone. According to current estimates, within that
short interval, North America lost thirty-four out of its forty-seven
genera of large mammals. South America lost fifty out of sixty. The
sabre-tooth cats, after flourishing for more than 30 million years,
disappeared, and so did the giant ground sloths, the oversized lions,
native American horses, native American camels, the giant rodents and
the mammoths. Thousands of species of smaller mammals, reptiles,
birds, and even insects and parasites also became extinct (when the
mammoths died out, all species of mammoth ticks followed them to
oblivion).
For decades, palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists – people who
search for and study animal remains – have been combing the plains and
mountains of the Americas in search of the fossilised bones of ancient
camels and the petrified faeces of giant ground sloths. When they find
what they seek, the treasures are carefully packed up and sent to
laboratories, where every bone and every coprolite (the technical name
for fossilised turds) is meticulously studied and dated. Time and again,
these analyses yield the same results: the freshest dung balls and the
most recent camel bones date to the period when humans flooded
America, that is, between approximately 12,000 and 9000 BC. Only in
one area have scientists discovered younger dung balls: on several
Caribbean islands, in particular Cuba and Hispaniola, they found
petrified ground-sloth scat dating to about 5000 BC. This is exactly the
time when the first humans managed to cross the Caribbean Sea and
settle these two large islands.
Again, some scholars try to exonerate Homo sapiens and blame climate
change (which requires them to posit that, for some mysterious reason,
the climate in the Caribbean islands remained static for 7,000 years
while the rest of the western hemisphere warmed). But in America, the
dung ball cannot be dodged. We are the culprits. There is no way around
that truth. Even if climate change abetted us, the human contribution
was decisive.7
Noah’s Ark
If we combine the mass extinctions in Australia and America, and add
the smaller-scale extinctions that took place as Homo sapiens spread over
Afro-Asia – such as the extinction of all other human species – and the
extinctions that occurred when ancient foragers settled remote islands
such as Cuba, the inevitable conclusion is that the first wave of Sapiens
colonisation was one of the biggest and swiftest ecological disasters to
befall the animal kingdom. Hardest hit were the large furry creatures. At
the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200
genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over fifty kilograms. At the
time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained.
Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts
long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.
This ecological tragedy was restaged in miniature countless times after
the Agricultural Revolution. The archaeological record of island after
island tells the same sad story. The tragedy opens with a scene showing
a rich and varied population of large animals, without any trace of
humans. In scene two, Sapiens appear, evidenced by a human bone, a
spear point, or perhaps a potsherd. Scene three quickly follows, in which
men and women occupy centre stage and most large animals, along with
many smaller ones, are gone.
The large island of Madagascar, about 400 kilometres east of the
African mainland, offers a famous example. Through millions of years of
isolation, a unique collection of animals evolved there. These included
the elephant bird, a flightless creature three metres tall and weighing
almost half a ton – the largest bird in the world – and the giant lemurs,
the globe’s largest primates. The elephant birds and the giant lemurs,
along with most of the other large animals of Madagascar, suddenly
vanished about 1,500 years ago – precisely when the first humans set
foot on the island.
10. Reconstructions of two giant ground sloths (Megatherium) and behind them two giant
armadillos (Glyptodon). Now extinct, giant armadillos measured over three metres in
length and weighed up to two tons, whereas giant ground sloths reached heights of up to
six metres, and weighed up to eight tons.
In the Pacific Ocean, the main wave of extinction began in about 1500
BC, when Polynesian farmers settled the Solomon Islands, Fiji and New
Caledonia. They killed off, directly or indirectly, hundreds of species of
birds, insects, snails and other local inhabitants. From there, the wave of
extinction moved gradually to the east, the south and the north, into the
heart of the Pacific Ocean, obliterating on its way the unique fauna of
Samoa and Tonga (1200 BC); the Marquis Islands (AD 1); Easter Island, the
Cook Islands and Hawaii (AD 500); and finally New Zealand (AD 1200).
Similar ecological disasters occurred on almost every one of the
thousands of islands that pepper the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean,
Arctic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have discovered on
even the tiniest islands evidence of the existence of birds, insects and
snails that lived there for countless generations, only to vanish when the
first human farmers arrived. None but a few extremely remote islands
escaped man’s notice until the modern age, and these islands kept their
fauna intact. The Galapagos Islands, to give one famous example,
remained uninhabited by humans until the nineteenth century, thus
preserving their unique menagerie, including their giant tortoises,
which, like the ancient diprotodons, show no fear of humans.
The First Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the
foragers, was followed by the Second Wave Extinction, which
accompanied the spread of the farmers, and gives us an important
perspective on the Third Wave Extinction, which industrial activity is
causing today. Don’t believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors
lived in harmony with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution,
Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most
plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious
distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.
Perhaps if more people were aware of the First Wave and Second
Wave extinctions, they’d be less nonchalant about the Third Wave they
are part of. If we knew how many species we’ve already eradicated, we
might be more motivated to protect those that still survive. This is
especially relevant to the large animals of the oceans. Unlike their
terrestrial counterparts, the large sea animals suffered relatively little
from the Cognitive and Agricultural Revolutions. But many of them are
on the brink of extinction now as a result of industrial pollution and
human overuse of oceanic resources. If things continue at the present
pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna and dolphins will follow the
diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to oblivion. Among all the
world’s large creatures, the only survivors of the human flood will be
humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as galley slaves
in Noah’s Ark.

History’s Biggest Fraud
FOR 2.5 MILLION YEARS HUMANS FED themselves by gathering plants
and hunting animals that lived and bred without their intervention.
Homo erectus, Homo ergaster and the Neanderthals plucked wild figs and
hunted wild sheep without deciding where fig trees would take root, in
which meadow a herd of sheep should graze, or which billy goat would
inseminate which nanny goat. Homo sapiens spread from East Africa to
the Middle East, to Europe and Asia, and finally to Australia and
America – but everywhere they went, Sapiens too continued to live by
gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals. Why do anything else
when your lifestyle feeds you amply and supports a rich world of social
structures, religious beliefs and political dynamics?
All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to
devote almost all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few
animal and plant species. From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds,
watered plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime
pastures. This work, they thought, would provide them with more fruit,
grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived – the
Agricultural Revolution.
The transition to agriculture began around 9500–8500 BC in the hill
country of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Levant. It began
slowly and in a restricted geographical area. Wheat and goats were
domesticated by approximately 9000 BC; peas and lentils around 8000 BC;
olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC.
Some animals and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were
domesticated even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication
was over. Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90
per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of
plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC –
wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley.
No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000
years. If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of
ancient farmers.
Scholars once believed that agriculture spread from a single Middle
Eastern point of origin to the four corners of the world. Today, scholars
agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world not by the
action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting their revolution but entirely
independently. People in Central America domesticated maize and beans
without knowing anything about wheat and pea cultivation in the
Middle East. South Americans learned how to raise potatoes and llamas,
unaware of what was going on in either Mexico or the Levant. Chinas
first revolutionaries domesticated rice, millet and pigs. North America’s
first gardeners were those who got tired of combing the undergrowth for
edible gourds and decided to cultivate pumpkins. New Guineans tamed
sugar cane and bananas, while the first West African farmers made
African millet, African rice, sorghum and wheat conform to their needs.
From these initial focal points, agriculture spread far and wide. By the
first century AD the vast majority of people throughout most of the world
were agriculturists.
Why did agricultural revolutions erupt in the Middle East, China and
Central America but not in Australia, Alaska or South Africa? The reason
is simple: most species of plants and animals can’t be domesticated.
Sapiens could dig up delicious truffles and hunt down woolly
mammoths, but domesticating either species was out of the question.
The fungi were far too elusive, the giant beasts too ferocious. Of the
thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few
were suitable candidates for farming and herding. Those few species
lived in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural
revolutions occurred.
Scholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great
leap forward for humanity. They told a tale of progress fuelled by human
brain power. Evolution gradually produced ever more intelligent people.
Eventually, people were so smart that they were able to decipher
nature’s secrets, enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheat. As
soon as this happened, they cheerfully abandoned the gruelling,
dangerous, and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to
enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.
Map 2. Locations and dates of agricultural revolutions. The data is contentious, and the
map is constantly being redrawn to incorporate the latest archaeological discoveries.1
That tale is a fantasy. There is no evidence that people became more
intelligent with time. Foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the
Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate
knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered.
Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural
Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less
satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in
more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation
and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total
of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate
into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population
explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than
the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural
Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.2
Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The
culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and
potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice
versa.
Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the
viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass,
one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly,
within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world.
According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction,
wheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the
earth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a
single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for
hundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other
plant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of
the globes surface, almost ten times the size of Britain. How did this
grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous?
Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape
had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until
about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort
in cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many
parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking
care of wheat plants. It wasn’t easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them.
Wheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs
clearing fields. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients
with other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under
the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out
for worms and blight. Wheat was defenceless against other organisms
that liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to
guard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from
springs and streams to water it. Its hunger even impelled Sapiens to
collect animal faeces to nourish the ground in which wheat grew.
The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was
adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to
clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks
and arches paid the price. Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the
transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as
slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks
demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently
next to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We
did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’
comes from the Latin domus, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living
in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens.
How did wheat convince Homo sapiens to exchange a rather good life
for a more miserable existence? What did it offer in return? It did not
offer a better diet. Remember, humans are omnivorous apes who thrive
on a wide variety of foods. Grains made up only a small fraction of the
human diet before the Agricultural Revolution. A diet based on cereals is
poor in minerals and vitamins, hard to digest, and really bad for your
teeth and gums.
Wheat did not give people economic security. The life of a peasant is
less secure than that of a hunter-gatherer. Foragers relied on dozens of
species to survive, and could therefore weather difficult years even
without stocks of preserved food. If the availability of one species was
reduced, they could gather and hunt more of other species. Farming
societies have, until very recently, relied for the great bulk of their
calorie intake on a small variety of domesticated plants. In many areas,
they relied on just a single staple, such as wheat, potatoes or rice. If the
rains failed or clouds of locusts arrived or if a fungus learned how to
infect that staple species, peasants died by the thousands and millions.
Nor could wheat offer security against human violence. The early
farmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not more so.
Farmers had more possessions and needed land for planting. The loss of
pasture land to raiding neighbours could mean the difference between
subsistence and starvation, so there was much less room for compromise.
When a foraging band was hard-pressed by a stronger rival, it could
usually move on. It was difficult and dangerous, but it was feasible.
When a strong enemy threatened an agricultural village, retreat meant
giving up fields, houses and granaries. In many cases, this doomed the
refugees to starvation. Farmers, therefore, tended to stay put and fight to
the bitter end.
12. Tribal warfare in New Guinea between two farming communities (1960). Such scenes
were probably widespread in the thousands of years following the Agricultural
Revolution.
Many anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that in
simple agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village
and tribe, human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of
deaths, including 25 per cent of male deaths. In contemporary New
Guinea, violence accounts for 30 per cent of male deaths in one
agricultural tribal society, the Dani, and 35 per cent in another, the
Enga. In Ecuador, perhaps 50 per cent of adult Waoranis meet a violent
death at the hands of another human!3 In time, human violence was
brought under control through the development of larger social
frameworks – cities, kingdoms and states. But it took thousands of years
to build such huge and effective political structures.
Village life certainly brought the first farmers some immediate
benefits, such as better protection against wild animals, rain and cold.
Yet for the average person, the disadvantages probably outweighed the
advantages. This is hard for people in today’s prosperous societies to
appreciate. Since we enjoy affluence and security, and since our
affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural
Revolution, we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful
improvement. Yet it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from
the perspective of today. A much more representative viewpoint is that
of a three-year-old girl dying from malnutrition in first-century China
because her father’s crops have failed. Would she say ‘I am dying from
malnutrition, but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live
in big air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice’?
What then did wheat offer agriculturists, including that malnourished
Chinese girl? It offered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did
bestow something on Homo sapiens as a species. Cultivating wheat
provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled
Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially. Around 13,000 BC, when people
fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the
area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one
roaming band of about a hundred relatively healthy and well-nourished
people. Around 8500 BC, when wild plants gave way to wheat fields, the
oasis supported a large but cramped village of 1,000 people, who
suffered far more from disease and malnourishment.
The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies
of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured
only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness
of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by
the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the
species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a
species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species
flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than
a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the
ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.
Yet why should individuals care about this evolutionary calculus?
Why would any sane person lower his or her standard of living just to
multiply the number of copies of the Homo sapiens genome? Nobody
agreed to this deal: the Agricultural Revolution was a trap.
The Luxury Trap
The rise of farming was a very gradual affair spread over centuries and
millennia. A band of Homo sapiens gathering mushrooms and nuts and
hunting deer and rabbit did not all of a sudden settle in a permanent
village, ploughing fields, sowing wheat and carrying water from the
river. The change proceeded by stages, each of which involved just a
small alteration in daily life.
Homo sapiens reached the Middle East around 70,000 years ago. For
the next 50,000 years our ancestors flourished there without agriculture.
The natural resources of the area were enough to support its human
population. In times of plenty people had a few more children, and in
times of need a few less. Humans, like many mammals, have hormonal
and genetic mechanisms that help control procreation. In good times
females reach puberty earlier, and their chances of getting pregnant are
a bit higher. In bad times puberty is late and fertility decreases.
To these natural population controls were added cultural mechanisms.
Babies and small children, who move slowly and demand much
attention, were a burden on nomadic foragers. People tried to space
their children three to four years apart. Women did so by nursing their
children around the clock and until a late age (around-the-clock suckling
significantly decreases the chances of getting pregnant). Other methods
included full or partial sexual abstinence (backed perhaps by cultural
taboos), abortions and occasionally infanticide.4
During these long millennia people occasionally ate wheat grain, but
this was a marginal part of their diet. About 18,000 years ago, the last
ice age gave way to a period of global warming. As temperatures rose, so
did rainfall. The new climate was ideal for Middle Eastern wheat and
other cereals, which multiplied and spread. People began eating more
wheat, and in exchange they inadvertently spread its growth. Since it
was impossible to eat wild grains without first winnowing, grinding and
cooking them, people who gathered these grains carried them back to
their temporary campsites for processing. Wheat grains are small and
numerous, so some of them inevitably fell on the way to the campsite
and were lost. Over time, more and more wheat grew along favourite
human trails and near campsites.
When humans burned down forests and thickets, this also helped
wheat. Fire cleared away trees and shrubs, allowing wheat and other
grasses to monopolise the sunlight, water and nutrients. Where wheat
became particularly abundant, and game and other food sources were
also plentiful, human bands could gradually give up their nomadic
lifestyle and settle down in seasonal and even permanent camps.
At first they might have camped for four weeks during the harvest. A
generation later, as wheat plants multiplied and spread, the harvest
camp might have lasted for five weeks, then six, and finally it became a
permanent village. Evidence of such settlements has been discovered
throughout the Middle East, particularly in the Levant, where the
Natufian culture flourished from 12,500 BC to 9500 BC. The Natufians
were hunter-gatherers who subsisted on dozens of wild species, but they
lived in permanent villages and devoted much of their time to the
intensive gathering and processing of wild cereals. They built stone
houses and granaries. They stored grain for times of need. They invented
new tools such as stone scythes for harvesting wild wheat, and stone
pestles and mortars to grind it.
In the years following 9500 BC, the descendants of the Natufians
continued to gather and process cereals, but they also began to cultivate
them in more and more elaborate ways. When gathering wild grains,
they took care to lay aside part of the harvest to sow the fields next
season. They discovered that they could achieve much better results by
sowing the grains deep in the ground rather than haphazardly scattering
them on the surface. So they began to hoe and plough. Gradually they
also started to weed the fields, to guard them against parasites, and to
water and fertilise them. As more effort was directed towards cereal
cultivation, there was less time to gather and hunt wild species. The
foragers became farmers.
No single step separated the woman gathering wild wheat from the
woman farming domesticated wheat, so it’s hard to say exactly when the
decisive transition to agriculture took place. But, by 8500 BC, the Middle
East was peppered with permanent villages such as Jericho, whose
inhabitants spent most of their time cultivating a few domesticated
species.
With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply,
the population began to grow. Giving up the nomadic lifestyle enabled
women to have a child every year. Babies were weaned at an earlier age
– they could be fed on porridge and gruel. The extra hands were sorely
needed in the fields. But the extra mouths quickly wiped out the food
surpluses, so even more fields had to be planted. As people began living
in disease-ridden settlements, as children fed more on cereals and less on
mother’s milk, and as each child competed for his or her porridge with
more and more siblings, child mortality soared. In most agricultural
societies at least one out of every three children died before reaching
twenty.5 Yet the increase in births still outpaced the increase in deaths;
humans kept having larger numbers of children.
With time, the ‘wheat bargain’ became more and more burdensome.
Children died in droves, and adults ate bread by the sweat of their
brows. The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than
the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody
realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the
previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in
the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’,
each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone
around the necks of these farmers.
Why did people make such a fateful miscalculation? For the same
reason that people throughout history have miscalculated. People were
unable to fathom the full consequences of their decisions. Whenever they
decided to do a bit of extra work – say, to hoe the fields instead of
scattering seeds on the surface – people thought, ‘Yes, we will have to
work harder. But the harvest will be so bountiful! We won’t have to
worry any more about lean years. Our children will never go to sleep
hungry.’ It made sense. If you worked harder, you would have a better
life. That was the plan.
The first part of the plan went smoothly. People indeed worked
harder. But people did not foresee that the number of children would
increase, meaning that the extra wheat would have to be shared between
more children. Neither did the early farmers understand that feeding
children with more porridge and less breast milk would weaken their
immune system, and that permanent settlements would be hotbeds for
infectious diseases. They did not foresee that by increasing their
dependence on a single source of food, they were actually exposing
themselves even more to the depredations of drought. Nor did the
farmers foresee that in good years their bulging granaries would tempt
thieves and enemies, compelling them to start building walls and doing
guard duty.
Then why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired?
Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate
and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had
ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned
humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s
population from a hundred to no, which ten people would have
volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old
times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.
The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the
last time. It happens to us today. How many young college graduates
have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will
work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue
their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach
that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the
suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life
is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays
abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No,
they double their efforts and keep slaving away.
One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become
necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a
certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it.
Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it. Let’s take
another familiar example from our own time. Over the last few decades,
we have invented countless time-saving devices that are supposed to
make life more relaxed – washing machines, vacuum cleaners,
dishwashers, telephones, mobile phones, computers, email. Previously it
took a lot of work to write a letter, address and stamp an envelope, and
take it to the mailbox. It took days or weeks, maybe even months, to get
a reply. Nowadays I can dash off an email, send it halfway around the
globe, and (if my addressee is online) receive a reply a minute later. I’ve
saved all that trouble and time, but do I live a more relaxed life?
Sadly not. Back in the snail-mail era, people usually only wrote letters
when they had something important to relate. Rather than writing the
first thing that came into their heads, they considered carefully what
they wanted to say and how to phrase it. They expected to receive a
similarly considered answer. Most people wrote and received no more
than a handful of letters a month and seldom felt compelled to reply
immediately. Today I receive dozens of emails each day, all from people
who expect a prompt reply. We thought we were saving time; instead we
revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed and made
our days more anxious and agitated.
Here and there a Luddite holdout refuses to open an email account,
just as thousands of years ago some human bands refused to take up
farming and so escaped the luxury trap. But the Agricultural Revolution
didn’t need every band in a given region to join up. It only took one.
Once one band settled down and started tilling, whether in the Middle
East or Central America, agriculture was irresistible. Since farming
created the conditions for swift demographic growth, farmers could
usually overcome foragers by sheer weight of numbers. The foragers
could either run away, abandoning their hunting grounds to field and
pasture, or take up the ploughshare themselves. Either way, the old life
was doomed.
The story of the luxury trap carries with it an important lesson.
Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change
that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted.
Nobody plotted the Agricultural Revolution or sought human
dependence on cereal cultivation. A series of trivial decisions aimed
mostly at filling a few stomachs and gaining a little security had the
cumulative effect of forcing ancient foragers to spend their days carrying
water buckets under a scorching sun.
Divine Intervention
The above scenario explains the Agricultural Revolution as a
miscalculation. It’s very plausible. History is full of far more idiotic
miscalculations. But there’s another possibility. Maybe it wasn’t the
search for an easier life that brought about the transformation. Maybe
Sapiens had other aspirations, and were consciously willing to make
their lives harder in order to achieve them.
Scientists usually seek to attribute historical developments to cold
economic and demographic factors. It sits better with their rational and
mathematical methods. In the case of modern history, scholars cannot
avoid taking into account non-material factors such as ideology and
culture. The written evidence forces their hand. We have enough
documents, letters and memoirs to prove that World War Two was not
caused by food shortages or demographic pressures. But we have no
documents from the Natufian culture, so when dealing with ancient
periods the materialist school reigns supreme. It is difficult to prove that
preliterate people were motivated by faith rather than economic
necessity.
Yet, in some rare cases, we are lucky enough to find telltale clues. In
1995 archaeologists began to excavate a site in south-east Turkey called
Göbekli Tepe. In the oldest stratum they discovered no signs of a
settlement, houses or daily activities. They did, however, find
monumental pillared structures decorated with spectacular engravings.
Each stone pillar weighed up to seven tons and reached a height of five
metres. In a nearby quarry they found a half-chiselled pillar weighing
fifty tons. Altogether, they uncovered more than ten monumental
structures, the largest of them nearly thirty metres across.
Archaeologists are familiar with such monumental structures from
sites around the world – the best-known example is Stonehenge in
Britain. Yet as they studied Göbekli Tepe, they discovered an amazing
fact. Stonehenge dates to 2500 BC, and was built by a developed
agricultural society. The structures at Göbekli Tepe are dated to about
9500 BC, and all available evidence indicates that they were built by
hunter-gatherers. The archaeological community initially found it
difficult to credit these findings, but one test after another confirmed
both the early date of the structures and the pre-agricultural society of
their builders. The capabilities of ancient foragers, and the complexity of
their cultures, seem to be far more impressive than was previously
suspected.

the decorated stone pillars (about five metres high).
Why would a foraging society build such structures? They had no
obvious utilitarian purpose. They were neither mammoth
slaughterhouses nor places to shelter from rain or hide from lions. That
leaves us with the theory that they were built for some mysterious
cultural purpose that archaeologists have a hard time deciphering.
Whatever it was, the foragers thought it worth a huge amount of effort
and time. The only way to build Göbekli Tepe was for thousands of
foragers belonging to different bands and tribes to cooperate over an
extended period of time. Only a sophisticated religious or ideological
system could sustain such efforts.
Göbekli Tepe held another sensational secret. For many years,
geneticists have been tracing the origins of domesticated wheat. Recent
discoveries indicate that at least one domesticated variant, einkorn
wheat, originated in the Karaçadag Hills – about thirty kilometres from
Göbekli Tepe.6
This can hardly be a coincidence. It’s likely that the cultural centre of
Göbekli Tepe was somehow connected to the initial domestication of
wheat by humankind and of humankind by wheat. In order to feed the
people who built and used the monumental structures, particularly large
quantities of food were required. It may well be that foragers switched
from gathering wild wheat to intense wheat cultivation, not to increase
their normal food supply, but rather to support the building and running
of a temple. In the conventional picture, pioneers first built a village,
and when it prospered, they set up a temple in the middle. But Göbekli
Tepe suggests that the temple may have been built first, and that a
village later grew up around it.
Victims of the Revolution
The Faustian bargain between humans and grains was not the only deal
our species made. Another deal was struck concerning the fate of
animals such as sheep, goats, pigs and chickens. Nomadic bands that
stalked wild sheep gradually altered the constitutions of the herds on
which they preyed. This process probably began with selective hunting.
Humans learned that it was to their advantage to hunt only adult rams
and old or sick sheep. They spared fertile females and young lambs in
order to safeguard the long-term vitality of the local herd. The second
step might have been to actively defend the herd against predators,
driving away lions, wolves and rival human bands. The band might next
have corralled the herd into a narrow gorge in order to better control
and defend it. Finally, people began to make a more careful selection
among the sheep in order to tailor them to human needs. The most
aggressive rams, those that showed the greatest resistance to human
control, were slaughtered first. So were the skinniest and most
inquisitive females. (Shepherds are not fond of sheep whose curiosity
takes them far from the herd.) With each passing generation, the sheep
became fatter, more submissive and less curious. Voilà! Mary had a little
lamb and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.
Alternatively, hunters may have caught and adopted’ a lamb, fattening
it during the months of plenty and slaughtering it in the leaner season.
At some stage they began keeping a greater number of such lambs. Some
of these reached puberty and began to procreate. The most aggressive
and unruly lambs were first to the slaughter. The most submissive, most
appealing lambs were allowed to live longer and procreate. The result
was a herd of domesticated and submissive sheep.
Such domesticated animals – sheep, chickens, donkeys and others –
supplied food (meat, milk, eggs), raw materials (skins, wool), and muscle
power. Transportation, ploughing, grinding and other tasks, hitherto
performed by human sinew, were increasingly carried out by animals. In
most farming societies people focused on plant cultivation; raising
animals was a secondary activity. But a new kind of society also
appeared in some places, based primarily on the exploitation of animals:
tribes of pastoralist herders.
As humans spread around the world, so did their domesticated
animals. Ten thousand years ago, not more than a few million sheep,
cattle, goats, boars and chickens lived in restricted Afro-Asian niches.
Today the world contains about a billion sheep, a billion pigs, more than
a billion cattle, and more than 25 billion chickens. And they are all over
the globe. The domesticated chicken is the most widespread fowl ever.
Following Homo sapiens, domesticated cattle, pigs and sheep are the
second, third and fourth most widespread large mammals in the world.
From a narrow evolutionary perspective, which measures success by the
number of DNA copies, the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful
boon for chickens, cattle, pigs and sheep.
Unfortunately, the evolutionary perspective is an incomplete measure
of success. It judges everything by the criteria of survival and
reproduction, with no regard for individual suffering and happiness.
Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success
story, but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever
lived. The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal
practices that only became crueller with the passing of the centuries.
The natural lifespan of wild chickens is about seven to twelve years,
and of cattle about twenty to twenty-five years. In the wild, most
chickens and cattle died long before that, but they still had a fair chance
of living for a respectable number of years. In contrast, the vast majority
of domesticated chickens and cattle are slaughtered at the age of
between a few weeks and a few months, because this has always been
the optimal slaughtering age from an economic perspective. (Why keep
feeding a cock for three years if it has already reached its maximum
weight after three months?)
Egg-laying hens, dairy cows and draught animals are sometimes
allowed to live for many years. But the price is subjugation to a way of
life completely alien to their urges and desires. It’s reasonable to assume,
for example, that bulls prefer to spend their days wandering over open
prairies in the company of other bulls and cows rather than pulling carts
and ploughshares under the yoke of a whip-wielding ape.
In order to turn bulls, horses, donkeys and camels into obedient
draught animals, their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken,
their aggression and sexuality contained, and their freedom of
movement curtailed. Farmers developed techniques such as locking
animals inside pens and cages, bridling them in harnesses and leashes,
training them with whips and cattle prods, and mutilating them. The
process of taming almost always involves the castration of males. This
restrains male aggression and enables humans selectively to control the
herd’s procreation.
14. A painting from an Egyptian grave, c.1200 BC: A pair of oxen ploughing a field. In the
wild, cattle roamed as they pleased in herds with a complex social structure. The
castrated and domesticated ox wasted away his life under the lash and in a narrow pen,
labouring alone or in pairs in a way that suited neither its body nor its social and
emotional needs. When an ox could no longer pull the plough, it was slaughtered. (Note
the hunched position of the Egyptian farmer who, much like the ox, spent his life in hard
labour oppressive to his body, his mind and his social relationships.)
In many New Guinean societies, the wealth of a person has
traditionally been determined by the number of pigs he or she owns. To
ensure that the pigs can’t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea
slice off a chunk of each pig’s nose. This causes severe pain whenever
the pig tries to sniff. Since the pigs cannot find food or even find their
way around without sniffing, this mutilation makes them completely
dependent on their human owners. In another area of New Guinea, it has
been customary to gouge out pigs’ eyes, so that they cannot even see
where they’re going.7
The dairy industry has its own ways of forcing animals to do its will.
Cows, goats and sheep produce milk only after giving birth to calves,
kids and lambs, and only as long as the youngsters are suckling. To
continue a supply of animal milk, a farmer needs to have calves, kids or
lambs for suckling, but must prevent them from monopolising the milk.
One common method throughout history was to simply slaughter the
calves and kids shortly after birth, milk the mother for all she was
worth, and then get her pregnant again. This is still a very widespread
technique. In many modern dairy farms a milk cow usually lives for
about five years before being slaughtered. During these five years she is
almost constantly pregnant, and is fertilised within 60 to 120 days after
giving birth in order to preserve maximum milk production. Her calves
are separated from her shortly after birth. The females are reared to
become the next generation of dairy cows, whereas the males are
handed over to the care of the meat industry.8
Another method is to keep the calves and kids near their mothers, but
prevent them by various stratagems from suckling too much milk. The
simplest way to do that is to allow the kid or calf to start suckling, but
drive it away once the milk starts flowing. This method usually
encounters resistance from both kid and mother. Some shepherd tribes
used to kill the offspring, eat its flesh, and then stuff the skin. The
stuffed offspring was then presented to the mother so that its presence
would encourage her milk production. The Nuer tribe in the Sudan went
so far as to smear stuffed animals with their mother’s urine, to give the
counterfeit calves a familiar, live scent. Another Nuer technique was to
tie a ring of thorns around a calf’s mouth, so that it pricks the mother
and causes her to resist suckling.9 Tuareg camel breeders in the Sahara
used to puncture or cut off parts of the nose and upper lip of young
camels in order to make suckling painful, thereby discouraging them
from consuming too much milk.10
Not all agricultural societies were this cruel to their farm animals. The
lives of some domesticated animals could be quite good. Sheep raised for
wool, pet dogs and cats, war horses and race horses often enjoyed
comfortable conditions. The Roman emperor Caligula allegedly planned
to appoint his favourite horse, Incitatus, to the consulship. Shepherds
and farmers throughout history showed affection for their animals and
have taken great care of them, just as many slaveholders felt affection
and concern for their slaves. It was no accident that kings and prophets
styled themselves as shepherds and likened the way they and the gods
cared for their people to a shepherd’s care for his flock.
15. A modern calf in an industrial meat farm. Immediately after birth the calf is separated
from its mother and locked inside a tiny cage not much bigger than the calf’s own body.
There the calf spends its entire life – about four months on average. It never leaves its
cage, nor is it allowed to play with other calves or even walk – all so that its muscles will
not grow strong. Soft muscles mean a soft and juicy steak. The first time the calf has a
chance to walk, stretch its muscles and touch other calves is on its way to the
slaughterhouse. In evolutionary terms, cattle represent one of the most successful animal
species ever to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable animals on
the planet.
Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd,
it’s hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of
domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible
catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild
rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a
calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy
steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the
last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little
consolation for the suffering the individual endures.
This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual
suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the
Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as
wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes
sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each
with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider
how evolutionary success translates into individual experience. In the
following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase
in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand
in hand with much individual suffering.
