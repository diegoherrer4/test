The ɹrst empire about which we have deɹnitive information was the Akkadian
Empire of Sargon the Great (c.2250 BC). Sargon began his career as the king of
Kish, a small city state in Mesopotamia. Within a few decades he managed to
conquer not only all other Mesopotamian city states, but also large territories
outside the Mesopotamian heartland. Sargon boasted that he had conquered the
entire world. In reality, his dominion stretched from the Persian Gulf to the
Mediterranean, and included most of today’s Iraq and Syria, along with a few
slices of modern Iran and Turkey.
The Akkadian Empire did not last long after its founder’s death, but Sargon left
behind an imperial mantle that seldom remained unclaimed. For the next 1,700
years, Assyrian, Babylonian and Hittite kings adopted Sargon as a role model,
boasting that they, too, had conquered the entire world. Then, around 550 BC,
Cyrus the Great of Persia came along with an even more impressive boast.

Map 4. The Akkadian Empire and the Persian Empire.

The kings of Assyria always remained the kings of Assyria. Even when they
claimed to rule the entire world, it was obvious that they were doing it for the
greater glory of Assyria, and they were not apologetic about it. Cyrus, on the
other hand, claimed not merely to rule the whole world, but to do so for the sake
of all people. ‘We are conquering you for your own beneɹt,’ said the Persians.
Cyrus wanted the peoples he subjected to love him and to count themselves lucky
to be Persian vassals. The most famous example of Cyrus’ innovative eʃorts to
gain the approbation of a nation living under the thumb of his empire was his
command that the Jewish exiles in Babylonia be allowed to return to their
Judaean homeland and rebuild their temple. He even oʃered them ɹnancial
assistance. Cyrus did not see himself as a Persian king ruling over Jews – he was
also the king of the Jews, and thus responsible for their welfare.
The presumption to rule the entire world for the beneɹt of all its inhabitants
was startling. Evolution has made Homo sapiens, like other social mammals, a
xenophobic creature. Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, ‘we’
and ‘they’. We are people like you and me, who share our language, religion and
customs. We are all responsible for each other, but not responsible for them. We
were always distinct from them, and owe them nothing. We don’t want to see any
of them in our territory, and we don’t care an iota what happens in their territory.
They are barely even human. In the language of the Dinka people of the Sudan,
‘Dinka’ simply means ‘people’. People who are not Dinka are not people. The

Dinka’s bitter enemies are the Nuer. What does the word Nuer mean in Nuer
language? It means ‘original people’. Thousands of kilometres from the Sudan
deserts, in the frozen ice-lands of Alaska and north-eastern Siberia, live the
Yupiks. What does Yupik mean in Yupik language? It means ‘real people’.3
In contrast with this ethnic exclusiveness, imperial ideology from Cyrus onward
has tended to be inclusive and all-encompassing. Even though it has often
emphasised racial and cultural diʃerences between rulers and ruled, it has still
recognised the basic unity of the entire world, the existence of a single set of
principles governing all places and times, and the mutual responsibilities of all
human beings. Humankind is seen as a large family: the privileges of the parents
go hand in hand with responsibility for the welfare of the children.
This new imperial vision passed from Cyrus and the Persians to Alexander the
Great, and from him to Hellenistic kings, Roman emperors, Muslim caliphs, Indian
dynasts, and eventually even to Soviet premiers and American presidents. This
benevolent imperial vision has justiɹed the existence of empires, and negated not
only attempts by subject peoples to rebel, but also attempts by independent
peoples to resist imperial expansion.
Similar imperial visions were developed independently of the Persian model in
other parts of the world, most notably in Central America, in the Andean region,
and in China. According to traditional Chinese political theory, Heaven (Tian) is
the source of all legitimate authority on earth. Heaven chooses the most worthy
person or family and gives them the Mandate of Heaven. This person or family
then rules over All Under Heaven (Tianxia) for the beneɹt of all its inhabitants.
Thus, a legitimate authority is – by deɹnition – universal. If a ruler lacks the
Mandate of Heaven, then he lacks legitimacy to rule even a single city. If a ruler
enjoys the mandate, he is obliged to spread justice and harmony to the entire
world. The Mandate of Heaven could not be given to several candidates
simultaneously, and consequently one could not legitimise the existence of more
than one independent state.
The ɹrst emperor of the united Chinese empire, Qín Shǐ Huángdì, boasted that
‘throughout the six directions [of the universe] everything belongs to the
emperor ... wherever there is a human footprint, there is not one who did not
become a subject [of the emperor] ... his kindness reaches even oxen and horses.
There is not one who did not beneɹt. Every man is safe under his own roof.’4 In
Chinese political thinking as well as Chinese historical memory, imperial periods
were henceforth seen as golden ages of order and justice. In contradiction to the
modern Western view that a just world is composed of separate nation states, in
China periods of political fragmentation were seen as dark ages of chaos and
injustice. This perception has had far-reaching implications for Chinese history.
Every time an empire collapsed, the dominant political theory goaded the powers

that be not to settle for paltry independent principalities, but to attempt
reunification. Sooner or later these attempts always succeeded.

When They Become Us

Empires have played a decisive part in amalgamating many small cultures into
fewer big cultures. Ideas, people, goods and technology spread more easily within
the borders of an empire than in a politically fragmented region. Often enough, it
was the empires themselves which deliberately spread ideas, institutions, customs
and norms. One reason was to make life easier for themselves. It is diɽcult to rule
an empire in which every little district has its own set of laws, its own form of
writing, its own language and its own money. Standardisation was a boon to
emperors.
A second and equally important reason why empires actively spread a common
culture was to gain legitimacy. At least since the days of Cyrus and Qín Shǐ
Huángdì, empires have justiɹed their actions – whether road-building or bloodshed
– as necessary to spread a superior culture from which the conquered beneɹt even
more than the conquerors.
The beneɹts were sometimes salient – law enforcement, urban planning,
standardisation of weights and measures – and sometimes questionable – taxes,
conscription, emperor worship. But most imperial elites earnestly believed that
they were working for the general welfare of all the empires inhabitants. China’s
ruling class treated their country’s neighbours and its foreign subjects as miserable
barbarians to whom the empire must bring the beneɹts of culture. The Mandate of
Heaven was bestowed upon the emperor not in order to exploit the world, but in
order to educate humanity. The Romans, too, justiɹed their dominion by arguing
that they were endowing the barbarians with peace, justice and reɹnement. The
wild Germans and painted Gauls had lived in squalor and ignorance until the
Romans tamed them with law, cleaned them up in public bathhouses, and
improved them with philosophy. The Mauryan Empire in the third century BC took
as its mission the dissemination of Buddha’s teachings to an ignorant world. The
Muslim caliphs received a divine mandate to spread the Prophet’s revelation,
peacefully if possible but by the sword if necessary. The Spanish and Portuguese
empires proclaimed that it was not riches they sought in the Indies and America,
but converts to the true faith. The sun never set on the British mission to spread
the twin gospels of liberalism and free trade. The Soviets felt duty-bound to
facilitate the inexorable historical march from capitalism towards the utopian
dictatorship of the proletariat. Many Americans nowadays maintain that their

government has a moral imperative to bring Third World countries the beneɹts of
democracy and human rights, even if these goods are delivered by cruise missiles
and F-16s.
The cultural ideas spread by empire were seldom the exclusive creation of the
ruling elite. Since the imperial vision tends to be universal and inclusive, it was
relatively easy for imperial elites to adopt ideas, norms and traditions from
wherever they found them, rather than to stick fanatically to a single hidebound
tradition. While some emperors sought to purify their cultures and return to what
they viewed as their roots, for the most part empires have begot hybrid
civilisations that absorbed much from their subject peoples. The imperial culture of
Rome was Greek almost as much as Roman. The imperial Abbasid culture was part
Persian, part Greek, part Arab. Imperial Mongol culture was a Chinese copycat. In
the imperial United States, an American president of Kenyan blood can munch on
Italian pizza while watching his favourite ɹlm, Lawrence of Arabia, a British epic
about the Arab rebellion against the Turks.
Not that this cultural melting pot made the process of cultural assimilation any
easier for the vanquished. The imperial civilisation may well have absorbed
numerous contributions from various conquered peoples, but the hybrid result was
still alien to the vast majority. The process of assimilation was often painful and
traumatic. It is not easy to give up a familiar and loved local tradition, just as it is
diɽcult and stressful to understand and adopt a new culture. Worse still, even
when subject peoples were successful in adopting the imperial culture, it could
take decades, if not centuries, until the imperial elite accepted them as part of ‘us’.
The generations between conquest and acceptance were left out in the cold. They
had already lost their beloved local culture, but they were not allowed to take an
equal part in the imperial world. On the contrary, their adopted culture continued
to view them as barbarians.
Imagine an Iberian of good stock living a century after the fall of Numantia. He
speaks his native Celtic dialect with his parents, but has acquired impeccable
Latin, with only a slight accent, because he needs it to conduct his business and
deal with the authorities. He indulges his wife’s penchant for elaborately ornate
baubles, but is a bit embarrassed that she, like other local women, retains this relic
of Celtic taste – he’d rather have her adopt the clean simplicity of the jewellery
worn by the Roman governor’s wife. He himself wears Roman tunics and, thanks
to his success as a cattle merchant, due in no small part to his expertise in the
intricacies of Roman commercial law, he has been able to build a Roman-style
villa. Yet, even though he can recite Book III of Virgil’s Georgics by heart, the
Romans still treat him as though he’s semi-barbarian. He realises with frustration
that he’ll never get a government appointment, or one of the really good seats in
the amphitheatre.

In the late nineteenth century, many educated Indians were taught the same
lesson by their British masters. One famous anecdote tells of an ambitious Indian

who mastered the intricacies of the English language, took lessons in Western-
style dance, and even became accustomed to eating with a knife and fork.

Equipped with his new manners, he travelled to England, studied law at
University College London, and became a qualiɹed barrister. Yet this young man
of law, bedecked in suit and tie, was thrown oʃ a train in the British colony of
South Africa for insisting on travelling ɹrst class instead of settling for third class,
where ‘coloured’ men like him were supposed to ride. His name was Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi.
In some cases the processes of acculturation and assimilation eventually broke
down the barriers between the newcomers and the old elite. The conquered no
longer saw the empire as an alien system of occupation, and the conquerors came
to view their subjects as equal to themselves. Rulers and ruled alike came to see
‘them’ as ‘us’. All the subjects of Rome eventually, after centuries of imperial rule,
were granted Roman citizenship. Non-Romans rose to occupy the top ranks in the
oɽcer corps of the Roman legions and were appointed to the Senate. In AD 48 the
emperor Claudius admitted to the Senate several Gallic notables, who, he noted in
a speech, through ‘customs, culture, and the ties of marriage have blended with
ourselves’. Snobbish senators protested introducing these former enemies into the
heart of the Roman political system. Claudius reminded them of an inconvenient
truth. Most of their own senatorial families descended from Italian tribes who
once fought against Rome, and were later granted Roman citizenship. Indeed, the
emperor reminded them, his own family was of Sabine ancestry.5
During the second century AD, Rome was ruled by a line of emperors born in
Iberia, in whose veins probably ɻowed at least a few drops of local Iberian blood.
The reigns of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninius Pius and Marcus Aurelius are generally
thought to constitute the empire’s golden age. After that, all the ethnic dams were
let down. Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) was the scion of a Punic family
from Libya. Elagabalus (218–22) was a Syrian. Emperor Philip (244–9) was
known colloquially as ‘Philip the Arab’. The empire’s new citizens adopted Roman
imperial culture with such zest that, for centuries and even millennia after the
empire itself collapsed, they continued to speak the empire’s language, to believe
in the Christian God that the empire had adopted from one of its Levantine
provinces, and to live by the empire’s laws.
A similar process occurred in the Arab Empire. When it was established in the
mid-seventh century AD, it was based on a sharp division between the ruling Arab–
Muslim elite and the subjugated Egyptians, Syrians, Iranians and Berbers, who
were neither Arabs nor Muslim. Many of the empire’s subjects gradually adopted
the Muslim faith, the Arabic language and a hybrid imperial culture. The old Arab

elite looked upon these parvenus with deep hostility, fearing to lose its unique
status and identity. The frustrated converts clamoured for an equal share within
the empire and in the world of Islam. Eventually they got their way. Egyptians,
Syrians and Mesopotamians were increasingly seen as ‘Arabs’. Arabs, in their turn
– whether authentic’ Arabs from Arabia or newly minted Arabs from Egypt and
Syria – came to be increasingly dominated by non-Arab Muslims, in particular by
Iranians, Turks and Berbers. The great success of the Arab imperial project was

that the imperial culture it created was wholeheartedly adopted by numerous non-
Arab people, who continued to uphold it, develop it and spread it – even after the

original empire collapsed and the Arabs as an ethnic group lost their dominion.
In China the success of the imperial project was even more thorough. For more
than 2,000 years, a welter of ethnic and cultural groups ɹrst termed barbarians
were successfully integrated into imperial Chinese culture and became Han
Chinese (so named after the Han Empire that ruled China from 206 BC to AD 220).
The ultimate achievement of the Chinese Empire is that it is still alive and kicking,
yet it is hard to see it as an empire except in outlying areas such as Tibet and
Xinjiang. More than 90 per cent of the population of China are seen by
themselves and by others as Han.
We can understand the decolonisation process of the last few decades in a
similar way. During the modern era Europeans conquered much of the globe under
the guise of spreading a superior Western culture. They were so successful that
billions of people gradually adopted signiɹcant parts of that culture. Indians,
Africans, Arabs, Chinese and Maoris learned French, English and Spanish. They
began to believe in human rights and the principle of self-determination, and they
adopted Western ideologies such as liberalism, capitalism, Communism, feminism
and nationalism.

The Imperial Cycle

During the twentieth century, local groups that had adopted Western values
claimed equality with their European conquerors in the name of these very values.
Many anti-colonial struggles were waged under the banners of self-determination,
socialism and human rights, all of which are Western legacies. Just as Egyptians,
Iranians and Turks adopted and adapted the imperial culture that they inherited
from the original Arab conquerors, so today’s Indians, Africans and Chinese have
accepted much of the imperial culture of their former Western overlords, while
seeking to mould it in accordance with their needs and traditions.

Good Guys and Bad Guys in History

It is tempting to divide history neatly into good guys and bad guys, with all
empires among the bad guys. For the vast majority of empires were founded on
blood, and maintained their power through oppression and war. Yet most of
today’s cultures are based on imperial legacies. If empires are by deɹnition bad,
what does that say about us?
There are schools of thought and political movements that seek to purge human
culture of imperialism, leaving behind what they claim is a pure, authentic
civilisation, untainted by sin. These ideologies are at best naïve; at worst they
serve as disingenuous window-dressing for crude nationalism and bigotry. Perhaps
you could make a case that some of the myriad cultures that emerged at the dawn
of recorded history were pure, untouched by sin and unadulterated by other
societies. But no culture since that dawn can reasonably make that claim,

certainly no culture that exists now on earth. All human cultures are at least in
part the legacy of empires and imperial civilisations, and no academic or political
surgery can cut out the imperial legacies without killing the patient.
Think, for example, about the love-hate relationship between the independent
Indian republic of today and the British Raj. The British conquest and occupation
of India cost the lives of millions of Indians, and was responsible for the
continuous humiliation and exploitation of hundreds of millions more. Yet many

Indians adopted, with the zest of converts, Western ideas such as self-
determination and human rights, and were dismayed when the British refused to

live up to their own declared values by granting native Indians either equal rights
as British subjects or independence.
Nevertheless, the modern Indian state is a child of the British Empire. The
British killed, injured and persecuted the inhabitants of the subcontinent, but they
also united a bewildering mosaic of warring kingdoms, principalities and tribes,
creating a shared national consciousness and a country that functioned more or
less as a single political unit. They laid the foundations of the Indian judicial
system, created its administrative structure, and built the railroad network that
was critical for economic integration. Independent India adopted Western
democracy, in its British incarnation, as its form of government. English is still the
subcontinent’s lingua franca, a neutral tongue that native speakers of Hindi,
Tamil and Malayalam can use to communicate. Indians are passionate cricket
players and chai (tea) drinkers, and both game and beverage are British legacies.
Commercial tea farming did not exist in India until the mid-nineteenth century,
when it was introduced by the British East India Company. It was the snobbish
British sahibs who spread the custom of tea drinking throughout the subcontinent.

28. The Chhatrapati Shivaji train station in Mumbai. It began its life as Victoria Station, Bombay. The
British built it in the Neo-Gothic style that was popular in late nineteenth-century Britain. A Hindu
nationalist government changed the names of both city and station, but showed no appetite for razing

such a magnificent building, even if it was built by foreign oppressors.

How many Indians today would want to call a vote to divest themselves of
democracy, English, the railway network, the legal system, cricket and tea on the
grounds that they are imperial legacies? And if they did, wouldn’t the very act of
calling a vote to decide the issue demonstrate their debt to their former overlords?

29. The Taj Mahal. An example of ‘authentic’ Indian culture, or the alien creation of Muslim imperialism?

Even if we were to completely disavow the legacy of a brutal empire in the
hope of reconstructing and safeguarding the ‘authentic’ cultures that preceded it,
in all probability what we will be defending is nothing but the legacy of an older
and no less brutal empire. Those who resent the mutilation of Indian culture by
the British Raj inadvertently sanctify the legacies of the Mughal Empire and the
conquering sultanate of Delhi. And whoever attempts to rescue ‘authentic Indian
culture’ from the alien inɻuences of these Muslim empires sanctiɹes the legacies of
the Gupta Empire, the Kushan Empire and the Maurya Empire. If an extreme
Hindu nationalist were to destroy all the buildings left by the British conquerors,
such as Mumbai’s main train station, what about the structures left by India’s

Muslim conquerors, such as the Taj Mahal?
Nobody really knows how to solve this thorny question of cultural inheritance.
Whatever path we take, the ɹrst step is to acknowledge the complexity of the
dilemma and to accept that simplistically dividing the past into good guys and bad
guys leads nowhere. Unless, of course, we are willing to admit that we usually
follow the lead of the bad guys.

The New Global Empire

Since around 200 BC, most humans have lived in empires. It seems likely that in the
future, too, most humans will live in one. But this time the empire will be truly
global. The imperial vision of dominion over the entire world could be imminent.
As the twenty-ɹrst century unfolds, nationalism is fast losing ground. More and
more people believe that all of humankind is the legitimate source of political
authority, rather than the members of a particular nationality, and that
safeguarding human rights and protecting the interests of the entire human
species should be the guiding light of politics. If so, having close to 200
independent states is a hindrance rather than a help. Since Swedes, Indonesians
and Nigerians deserve the same human rights, wouldn’t it be simpler for a single
global government to safeguard them?
The appearance of essentially global problems, such as melting ice caps, nibbles
away at whatever legitimacy remains to the independent nation states. No
sovereign state will be able to overcome global warming on its own. The Chinese
Mandate of Heaven was given by Heaven to solve the problems of humankind.
The modern Mandate of Heaven will be given by humankind to solve the
problems of heaven, such as the hole in the ozone layer and the accumulation of
greenhouse gases. The colour of the global empire may well be green.
As of 2014, the world is still politically fragmented, but states are fast losing
their independence. Not one of them is really able to execute independent
economic policies, to declare and wage wars as it pleases, or even to run its own
internal aʃairs as it sees ɹt. States are increasingly open to the machinations of
global markets, to the interference of global companies and NGOs, and to the
supervision of global public opinion and the international judicial system. States
are obliged to conform to global standards of ɹnancial behaviour, environmental
policy and justice. Immensely powerful currents of capital, labour and
information turn and shape the world, with a growing disregard for the borders
and opinions of states.
The global empire being forged before our eyes is not governed by any

particular state or ethnic group. Much like the Late Roman Empire, it is ruled by a
multi-ethnic elite, and is held together by a common culture and common
interests. Throughout the world, more and more entrepreneurs, engineers, experts,
scholars, lawyers and managers are called to join the empire. They must ponder
whether to answer the imperial call or to remain loyal to their state and their
people. More and more choose the empire.

The Law of Religion

IN THE MEDIEVAL MARKET IN SAMARKAND, a city built on a Central Asian
oasis, Syrian merchants ran their hands over ɹne Chinese silks, ɹerce tribesmen
from the steppes displayed the latest batch of straw-haired slaves from the far
west, and shopkeepers pocketed shiny gold coins imprinted with exotic scripts and
the proɹles of unfamiliar kings. Here, at one of that era’s major crossroads
between east and west, north and south, the uniɹcation of humankind was an
everyday fact. The same process could be observed at work when Kublai Khan’s
army mustered to invade Japan in 1281. Mongol cavalrymen in skins and furs
rubbed shoulders with Chinese foot soldiers in bamboo hats, drunken Korean
auxiliaries picked ɹghts with tattooed sailors from the South China Sea, engineers
from Central Asia listened with dropping jaws to the tall tales of European
adventurers, and all obeyed the command of a single emperor.
Meanwhile, around the holy Ka’aba in Mecca, human uniɹcation was
proceeding by other means. Had you been a pilgrim to Mecca, circling Islam’s
holiest shrine in the year 1300, you might have found yourself in the company of
a party from Mesopotamia, their robes ɻoating in the wind, their eyes blazing
with ecstasy, and their mouths repeating one after the other the ninety-nine
names of God. Just ahead you might have seen a weather-beaten Turkish patriarch
from the Asian steppes, hobbling on a stick and stroking his beard thoughtfully. To
one side, gold jewellery shining against jet-black skin, might have been a group of
Muslims from the African kingdom of Mali. The aroma of clove, turmeric,
cardamom and sea salt would have signalled the presence of brothers from India,
or perhaps from the mysterious spice islands further east.
Today religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and
disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great uniɹer of humankind,
alongside money and empires. Since all social orders and hierarchies are
imagined, they are all fragile, and the larger the society, the more fragile it is. The
crucial historical role of religion has been to give superhuman legitimacy to these
fragile structures. Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human
caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place
at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social

stability.
Religion can thus be deɹned as a system of human norms and values that is
founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This involves two distinct criteria:
1. Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of
human whims or agreements. Professional football is not a religion, because
despite its many laws, rites and often bizarre rituals, everyone knows that human
beings invented football themselves, and FIFA may at any moment enlarge the
size of the goal or cancel the offside rule.
2. Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it
considers binding. Many Westerners today believe in ghosts, fairies and
reincarnation, but these beliefs are not a source of moral and behavioural
standards. As such, they do not constitute a religion.
Despite their ability to legitimise widespread social and political orders, not all
religions have actuated this potential. In order to unite under its aegis a large
expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of human beings, a religion
must possess two further qualities. First, it must espouse a universal superhuman
order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this
belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary.
The best-known religions of history, such as Islam and Buddhism, are universal
and missionary. Consequently people tend to believe that all religions are like
them. In fact, the majority of ancient religions were local and exclusive. Their
followers believed in local deities and spirits, and had no interest in converting
the entire human race. As far as we know, universal and missionary religions
began to appear only in the ɹrst millennium BC. Their emergence was one of the
most important revolutions in history, and made a vital contribution to the
uniɹcation of humankind, much like the emergence of universal empires and
universal money.

Silencing the Lambs

When animism was the dominant belief system, human norms and values had to
take into consideration the outlook and interests of a multitude of other beings,
such as animals, plants, fairies and ghosts. For example, a forager band in the
Ganges Valley may have established a rule forbidding people to cut down a
particularly large ɹg tree, lest the ɹg-tree spirit become angry and take revenge.
Another forager band living in the Indus Valley may have forbidden people from
hunting white-tailed foxes, because a white-tailed fox once revealed to a wise old
woman where the band might find precious obsidian.

Such religions tended to be very local in outlook, and to emphasise the unique
features of speciɹc locations, climates and phenomena. Most foragers spent their
entire lives within an area of no more than a thousand square kilometres. In order

to survive, the inhabitants of a particular valley needed to understand the super-
human order that regulated their valley, and to adjust their behaviour accordingly.

It was pointless to try to convince the inhabitants of some distant valley to follow
the same rules. The people of the Indus did not bother to send missionaries to the
Ganges to convince locals not to hunt white-tailed foxes.
The Agricultural Revolution seems to have been accompanied by a religious
revolution. Hunter-gatherers picked and pursued wild plants and animals, which
could be seen as equal in status to Homo sapiens. The fact that man hunted sheep
did not make sheep inferior to man, just as the fact that tigers hunted man did not
make man inferior to tigers. Beings communicated with one another directly and
negotiated the rules governing their shared habitat. In contrast, farmers owned
and manipulated plants and animals, and could hardly degrade themselves by
negotiating with their possessions. Hence the ɹrst religious eʃect of the
Agricultural Revolution was to turn plants and animals from equal members of a
spiritual round table into property.
This, however, created a big problem. Farmers may have desired absolute
control of their sheep, but they knew perfectly well that their control was limited.
They could lock the sheep in pens, castrate rams and selectively breed ewes, yet
they could not ensure that the ewes conceived and gave birth to healthy lambs,
nor could they prevent the eruption of deadly epidemics. How then to safeguard
the fecundity of the flocks?
A leading theory about the origin of the gods argues that gods gained
importance because they oʃered a solution to this problem. Gods such as the
fertility goddess, the sky god and the god of medicine took centre stage when
plants and animals lost their ability to speak, and the gods’ main role was to
mediate between humans and the mute plants and animals. Much of ancient
mythology is in fact a legal contract in which humans promise everlasting
devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals – the ɹrst
chapters of the book of Genesis are a prime example. For thousands of years after
the Agricultural Revolution, religious liturgy consisted mainly of humans
sacriɹcing lambs, wine and cakes to divine powers, who in exchange promised
abundant harvests and fecund flocks.
The Agricultural Revolution initially had a far smaller impact on the status of
other members of the animist system, such as rocks, springs, ghosts and demons.
However, these too gradually lost status in favour of the new gods. As long as
people lived their entire lives within limited territories of a few hundred square
kilometres, most of their needs could be met by local spirits. But once kingdoms

and trade networks expanded, people needed to contact entities whose power and
authority encompassed a whole kingdom or an entire trade basin.
The attempt to answer these needs led to the appearance of polytheistic
religions (from the Greek: poly = many, theos = god). These religions understood
the world to be controlled by a group of powerful gods, such as the fertility
goddess, the rain god and the war god. Humans could appeal to these gods and
the gods might, if they received devotions and sacriɹces, deign to bring rain,
victory and health.
Animism did not entirely disappear at the advent of polytheism. Demons,
fairies, ghosts, holy rocks, holy springs and holy trees remained an integral part of
almost all polytheist religions. These spirits were far less important than the great
gods, but for the mundane needs of many ordinary people, they were good
enough. While the king in his capital city sacriɹced dozens of fat rams to the great
war god, praying for victory over the barbarians, the peasant in his hut lit a
candle to the fig-tree fairy, praying that she help cure his sick son.
Yet the greatest impact of the rise of great gods was not on sheep or demons,
but upon the status of Homo sapiens. Animists thought that humans were just one
of many creatures inhabiting the world. Polytheists, on the other hand,
increasingly saw the world as a reɻection of the relationship between gods and
humans. Our prayers, our sacriɹces, our sins and our good deeds determined the
fate of the entire ecosystem. A terrible ɻood might wipe out billions of ants,
grasshoppers, turtles, antelopes, giraʃes and elephants, just because a few stupid
Sapiens made the gods angry. Polytheism thereby exalted not only the status of
the gods, but also that of humankind. Less fortunate members of the old animist
system lost their stature and became either extras or silent decor in the great
drama of man’s relationship with the gods.

The Benefits of Idolatry

Two thousand years of monotheistic brainwashing have caused most Westerners to
see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry. This is an unjust stereotype. In
order to understand the inner logic of polytheism, it is necessary to grasp the
central idea buttressing the belief in many gods.
Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law
governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions
recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the diʃerent gods,
demons and holy rocks. In classical Greek polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and
their colleagues were subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate

(Moira, Ananke). Nordic gods, too, were in thrall to fate, which doomed them to
perish in the cataclysm of Ragnarök (the Twilight of the Gods). In the polytheistic
religion of the Yoruba of West Africa, all gods were born of the supreme god
Olodumare, and remained subject to him. In Hindu polytheism, a single principle,
Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirits, humankind, and the biological and
physical world. Atman is the eternal essence or soul of the entire universe, as well
as of every individual and every phenomenon.
The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism,
is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases,
and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of
humans. It’s pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health or for rain,
because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no diʃerence whether
a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers,
whether a particular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any
sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman.
The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to
renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to embrace even
defeat, poverty, sickness and death. Thus some Hindus, known as Sadhus or
Sannyasis, devote their lives to uniting with Atman, thereby achieving
enlightenment. They strive to see the world from the viewpoint of this
fundamental principle, to realise that from its eternal perspective all mundane
desires and fears are meaningless and ephemeral phenomena.
Most Hindus, however, are not Sadhus. They are sunk deep in the morass of
mundane concerns, where Atman is not much help. For assistance in such matters,
Hindus approach the gods with their partial powers. Precisely because their
powers are partial rather than all-encompassing, gods such as Ganesha, Lakshmi
and Saraswati have interests and biases. Humans can therefore make deals with
these partial powers and rely on their help in order to win wars and recuperate
from illness. There are necessarily many of these smaller powers, since once you
start dividing up the all-encompassing power of a supreme principle, you’ll
inevitably end up with more than one deity. Hence the plurality of gods.
The insight of polytheism is conducive to far-reaching religious tolerance. Since
polytheists believe, on the one hand, in one supreme and completely disinterested
power, and on the other hand in many partial and biased powers, there is no
diɽculty for the devotees of one god to accept the existence and eɽcacy of other
gods. Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes ‘heretics’ and
‘infidels’.
Even when polytheists conquered huge empires, they did not try to convert their
subjects. The Egyptians, the Romans and the Aztecs did not send missionaries to
foreign lands to spread the worship of Osiris, Jupiter or Huitzilopochtli (the chief

Aztec god), and they certainly didn’t dispatch armies for that purpose. Subject
peoples throughout the empire were expected to respect the empire’s gods and
rituals, since these gods and rituals protected and legitimised the empire. Yet they
were not required to give up their local gods and rituals. In the Aztec Empire,
subject peoples were obliged to build temples for Huitzilopochtli, but these
temples were built alongside those of local gods, rather than in their stead. In
many cases the imperial elite itself adopted the gods and rituals of subject people.
The Romans happily added the Asian goddess Cybele and the Egyptian goddess
Isis to their pantheon.
The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and
evangelising god of the Christians. The Roman Empire did not require the
Christians to give up their beliefs and rituals, but it did expect them to pay respect
to the empire’s protector gods and to the divinity of the emperor. This was seen as
a declaration of political loyalty. When the Christians vehemently refused to do
so, and went on to reject all attempts at compromise, the Romans reacted by
persecuting what they understood to be a politically subversive faction. And even
this was done half-heartedly. In the 300 years from the cruciɹxion of Christ to the
conversion of Emperor Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no
more than four general persecutions of Christians. Local administrators and
governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine
all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries,
the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.1 In
contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians
by the millions to defend slightly diʃerent interpretations of the religion of love
and compassion.
The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved
accepted Christ’s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they
disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is
so great that God was incarnated in ɻesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and
cruciɹed, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to
all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while
essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church
rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid
pro quo belittles God’s greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven
depends upon his or her own good deeds magniɹes his own importance, and
implies that Christ’s suʃering on the cross and God’s love for humankind are not
enough.
These theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds

of thousands. On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of
good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God’s
love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, between
5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours.
When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy
that he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned
Giorgio Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican’s rooms with a fresco of the
massacre (the room is currently oʃ-limits to visitors).2 More Christians were killed
by fellow Christians in those twenty-four hours than by the polytheistic Roman
Empire throughout its entire existence.

God is One

With time some followers of polytheist gods became so fond of their particular
patron that they drifted away from the basic polytheist insight. They began to
believe that their god was the only god, and that He was in fact the supreme
power of the universe. Yet at the same time they continued to view Him as
possessing interests and biases, and believed that they could strike deals with Him.
Thus were born monotheist religions, whose followers beseech the supreme power
of the universe to help them recover from illness, win the lottery and gain victory
in war.
The ɹrst monotheist religion known to us appeared in Egypt, c.350 BC, when
Pharaoh Akhenaten declared that one of the minor deities of the Egyptian
pantheon, the god Aten, was, in fact, the supreme power ruling the universe.
Akhenaten institutionalised the worship of Aten as the state religion and tried to
check the worship of all other gods. His religious revolution, however, was
unsuccessful. After his death, the worship of Aten was abandoned in favour of the
old pantheon.
Polytheism continued to give birth here and there to other monotheist religions,
but they remained marginal, not least because they failed to digest their own
universal message. Judaism, for example, argued that the supreme power of the
universe has interests and biases, yet His chief interest is in the tiny Jewish nation
and in the obscure land of Israel. Judaism had little to oʃer other nations, and
throughout most of its existence it has not been a missionary religion. This stage
can be called the stage of ‘local monotheism’.
The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric

Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-
awaited messiah. However, one of the sect’s ɹrst leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned

that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had
bothered to incarnate Himself in the ɻesh and to die on the cross for the salvation
of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews. It
was thus necessary to spread the good word – the gospel – about Jesus throughout
the world.
Paul’s arguments fell on fertile ground. Christians began organising widespread
missionary activities aimed at all humans. In one of history’s strangest twists, this
esoteric Jewish sect took over the mighty Roman Empire.
Christian success served as a model for another monotheist religion that
appeared in the Arabian peninsula in the seventh century – Islam. Like
Christianity, Islam, too, began as a small sect in a remote corner of the world, but
in an even stranger and swifter historical surprise it managed to break out of the
deserts of Arabia and conquer an immense empire stretching from the Atlantic
Ocean to India. Henceforth, the monotheist idea played a central role in world
history.
Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than
polytheists. A religion that recognises the legitimacy of other faiths implies either
that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it received from God
just part of the universal truth. Since monotheists have usually believed that they
are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been
compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists
repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all
competition.
It worked. At the beginning of the ɹrst century AD, there were hardly any
monotheists in the world. Around AD 500, one of the world’s largest empires – the
Roman Empire – was a Christian polity, and missionaries were busy spreading
Christianity to other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. By the end of the ɹrst
millennium AD, most people in Europe, West Asia and North Africa were
monotheists, and empires from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalayas claimed to be
ordained by the single great God. By the early sixteenth century, monotheism
dominated most of Afro-Asia, with the exception of East Asia and the southern
parts of Africa, and it began extending long tentacles towards South Africa,
America and Oceania. Today most people outside East Asia adhere to one
monotheist religion or another, and the global political order is built on
monotheistic foundations.
Yet just as animism continued to survive within polytheism, so polytheism
continued to survive within monotheism. In theory, once a person believes that
the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, what’s the point in
worshipping partial powers? Who would want to approach a lowly bureaucrat
when the president’s oɽce is open to you? Indeed, monotheist theology tends to

deny the existence of all gods except the supreme God, and to pour hellɹre and
brimstone over anyone who dares worship them.

Map 5. The Spread of Christianity and Islam.

Yet there has always been a chasm between theological theories and historical
realities. Most people have found it diɽcult to digest the monotheist idea fully.
They have continued to divide the world into ‘we’ and ‘they’, and to see the
supreme power of the universe as too distant and alien for their mundane needs.
The monotheist religions expelled the gods through the front door with a lot of
fanfare, only to take them back in through the side window. Christianity, for
example, developed its own pantheon of saints, whose cults diʃered little from
those of the polytheistic gods.
Just as the god Jupiter defended Rome and Huitzilopochtli protected the Aztec
Empire, so every Christian kingdom had its own patron saint who helped it
overcome diɽculties and win wars. England was protected by St George, Scotland
by St Andrew, Hungary by St Stephen, and France had St Martin. Cities and
towns, professions, and even diseases – each had their own saint. The city of
Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian protected
chimney cleaners, whereas St Mathew lent a hand to tax collectors in distress. If
you suʃered from headaches you had to pray to St Agathius, but if from
toothaches, then St Apollonia was a much better audience.
The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often

they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of
Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was
Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the
most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.

The Battle of Good and Evil

Polytheism gave birth not merely to monotheist religions, but also to dualistic
ones. Dualistic religions espouse the existence of two opposing powers: good and
evil. Unlike monotheism, dualism believes that evil is an independent power,
neither created by the good God, nor subordinate to it. Dualism explains that the
entire universe is a battleground between these two forces, and that everything
that happens in the world is part of the struggle.
Dualism is a very attractive world view because it has a short and simple
answer to the famous Problem of Evil, one of the fundamental concerns of human
thought. ‘Why is there evil in the world? Why is there suʃering? Why do bad
things happen to good people?’ Monotheists have to practise intellectual
gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God
allows so much suʃering in the world. One well-known explanation is that this is
God’s way of allowing for human free will. Were there no evil, humans could not
choose between good and evil, and hence there would be no free will. This,
however, is a non-intuitive answer that immediately raises a host of new
questions. Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed choose evil
and, according to the standard monotheist account, this choice must bring divine
punishment in its wake. If God knew in advance that a particular person would
use her free will to choose evil, and that as a result she would be punished for this
by eternal tortures in hell, why did God create her? Theologians have written
countless books to answer such questions. Some ɹnd the answers convincing.
Some don’t. What’s undeniable is that monotheists have a hard time dealing with
the Problem of Evil.
For dualists, it’s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people
because the world is not governed single-handedly by a good God. There is an
independent evil power loose in the world. The evil power does bad things.
Dualism has its own drawbacks. While solving the Problem of Evil, it is
unnerved by the Problem of Order. If the world was created by a single God, it’s
clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if
Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing
this cosmic war? Two rival states can ɹght one another because both obey the

same laws of physics. A missile launched from Pakistan can hit targets in India
because gravity works the same way in both countries. When Good and Evil ɹght,
what common laws do they obey, and who decreed these laws?
So, monotheism explains order, but is mystiɹed by evil. Dualism explains evil,
but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue
that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s
evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.

Dualistic religions ɻourished for more than a thousand years. Sometime between
1500 BC and 1000 BC a prophet named Zoroaster (Zarathustra) was active
somewhere in Central Asia. His creed passed from generation to generation until
it became the most important of dualistic religions – Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians
saw the world as a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil
god Angra Mainyu. Humans had to help the good god in this battle.
Zoroastrianism was an important religion during the Achaemenid Persian Empire
(550–330 BC) and later became the oɽcial religion of the Sassanid Persian Empire
(AD 224–651). It exerted a major influence on almost all subsequent Middle Eastern
and Central Asian religions, and it inspired a number of other dualist religions,
such as Gnosticism and Manichaeanism.
During the third and fourth centuries AD, the Manichaean creed spread from
China to North Africa, and for a moment it appeared that it would beat
Christianity to achieve dominance in the Roman Empire. Yet the Manichaeans lost
the soul of Rome to the Christians, the Zoroastrian Sassanid Empire was overrun
by the monotheistic Muslims, and the dualist wave subsided. Today only a handful
of dualist communities survive in India and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the rising tide of monotheism did not really wipe out dualism.
Jewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous dualist beliefs and
practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what we call ‘monotheism’ are, in
fact, dualist in origin and spirit. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in
a powerful evil force – like the one Christians call the Devil or Satan – who can
act independently, ɹght against the good God, and wreak havoc without God’s
permission.
How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is
nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is impossible. Either you
believe in a single omnipotent God or you believe in two opposing powers,
neither of which is omnipotent. Still, humans have a wonderful capacity to believe
in contradictions. So it should not come as a surprise that millions of pious
Christians, Muslims and Jews manage to believe at one and the same time in an
omnipotent God and an independent Devil. Countless Christians, Muslims and

Jews have gone so far as to imagine that the good God even needs our help in its
struggle against the Devil, which inspired among other things the call for jihads
and crusades.
Another key dualistic concept, particularly in Gnosticism and Manichaeanism,
was the sharp distinction between body and soul, between matter and spirit.
Gnostics and Manichaeans argued that the good god created the spirit and the
soul, whereas matter and bodies are the creation of the evil god. Man, according
to this view, serves as a battleground between the good soul and the evil body.
From a monotheistic perspective, this is nonsense – why distinguish so sharply
between body and soul, or matter and spirit? And why argue that body and matter
are evil? After all, everything was created by the same good God. But monotheists
could not help but be captivated by dualist dichotomies, precisely because they
helped them address the problem of evil. So such oppositions eventually became
cornerstones of Christian and Muslim thought. Belief in heaven (the realm of the
good god) and hell (the realm of the evil god) was also dualist in origin. There is
no trace of this belief in the Old Testament, which also never claims that the souls
of people continue to live after the death of the body.
In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of
monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a
single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but
also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. Scholars of
religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of diʃerent and even
contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from
diʃerent sources. It’s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single
great world religion.

The Law of Nature

All the religions we have discussed so far share one important characteristic: they
all focus on a belief in gods and other supernatural entities. This seems obvious to
Westerners, who are familiar mainly with monotheistic and polytheist creeds. In
fact, however, the religious history of the world does not boil down to the history
of gods. During the ɹrst millennium BC, religions of an altogether new kind began
to spread through Afro-Asia. The newcomers, such as Jainism and Buddhism in
India, Daoism and Confucianism in China, and Stoicism, Cynicism and
Epicureanism in the Mediterranean basin, were characterised by their disregard of
gods.
These creeds maintained that the superhuman order governing the world is the

product of natural laws rather than of divine wills and whims. Some of these
natural-law religions continued to espouse the existence of gods, but their gods
were subject to the laws of nature no less than humans, animals and plants were.
Gods had their niche in the ecosystem, just as elephants and porcupines had theirs,
but could no more change the laws of nature than elephants can. A prime example
is Buddhism, the most important of the ancient natural law religions, which
remains one of the major faiths.
The central ɹgure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha
Gautama. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was heir to a small
Himalayan kingdom, sometime around 500 BC. The young prince was deeply
aʃected by the suʃering evident all around him. He saw that men and women,
children and old people, all suʃer not just from occasional calamities such as war
and plague, but also from anxiety, frustration and discontent, all of which seem to
be an inseparable part of the human condition. People pursue wealth and power,
acquire knowledge and possessions, beget sons and daughters, and build houses
and palaces. Yet no matter what they achieve, they are never content. Those who
live in poverty dream of riches. Those who have a million want two million. Those
who have two million want 10 million. Even the rich and famous are rarely
satisɹed. They too are haunted by ceaseless cares and worries, until sickness, old
age and death put a bitter end to them. Everything that one has accumulated
vanishes like smoke. Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it?
At the age of twenty-nine Gautama slipped away from his palace in the middle
of the night, leaving behind his family and possessions. He travelled as a homeless
vagabond throughout northern India, searching for a way out of suʃering. He
visited ashrams and sat at the feet of gurus but nothing liberated him entirely –
some dissatisfaction always remained. He did not despair. He resolved to
investigate suʃering on his own until he found a method for complete liberation.
He spent six years meditating on the essence, causes and cures for human anguish.
In the end he came to the realisation that suʃering is not caused by ill fortune, by
social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suʃering is caused by the behaviour
patterns of one’s own mind.
Gautama’s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually
reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind
experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the irritation. When the
mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and
will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatisɹed and restless. This is very
clear when we experience unpleasant things, such as pain. As long as the pain
continues, we are dissatisɹed and do all we can to avoid it. Yet even when we
experience pleasant things we are never content. We either fear that the pleasure
might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify. People dream for years about

ɹnding love but are rarely satisɹed when they ɹnd it. Some become anxious that
their partner will leave; others feel that they have settled cheaply, and could have
found someone better. And we all know people who manage to do both.

Map 6. The Spread of Buddhism.

Great gods can send us rain, social institutions can provide justice and good
health care, and lucky coincidences can turn us into millionaires, but none of them
can change our basic mental patterns. Hence even the greatest kings are doomed
to live in angst, constantly ɻeeing grief and anguish, forever chasing after greater
pleasures.
Gautama found that there was a way to exit this vicious circle. If, when the
mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things
as they are, then there is no suʃering. If you experience sadness without craving
that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suʃer from
it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without
craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing
your peace of mind.
But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To
accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of
meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without
craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question,

‘What am I experiencing now?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be
experiencing?’ It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible.
Gautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical rules meant to
make it easier for people to focus on actual experience and to avoid falling into
cravings and fantasies. He instructed his followers to avoid killing, promiscuous
sex and theft, since such acts necessarily stoke the ɹre of craving (for power, for
sensual pleasure, or for wealth). When the ɻames are completely extinguished,
craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as
nirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the ɹre’). Those who have
attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suʃering. They experience reality
with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions. While they will most likely
still encounter unpleasantness and pain, such experiences cause them no misery. A
person who does not crave cannot suffer.
According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama himself attained nirvana and was
fully liberated from suʃering. Henceforth he was known as ‘Buddha’, which means
‘The Enlightened One’. Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries
to others so that everyone could be freed from suʃering. He encapsulated his
teachings in a single law: suʃering arises from craving; the only way to be fully
liberated from suʃering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to
be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.
This law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by Buddhists as a universal law
of nature. That ‘suʃering arises from craving’ is always and everywhere true, just
as in modern physics E always equals mc2. Buddhists are people who believe in
this law and make it the fulcrum of all their activities. Belief in gods, on the other
hand, is of minor importance to them. The ɹrst principle of monotheist religions is
‘God exists. What does He want from me?’ The ɹrst principle of Buddhism is
‘Suffering exists. How do I escape it?’
Buddhism does not deny the existence of gods – they are described as powerful
beings who can bring rains and victories – but they have no inɻuence on the law
that suʃering arises from craving. If the mind of a person is free of all craving, no
god can make him miserable. Conversely, once craving arises in a person’s mind,
all the gods in the universe cannot save him from suffering.
Yet much like the monotheist religions, premodern natural-law religions such as
Buddhism never really rid themselves of the worship of gods. Buddhism told
people that they should aim for the ultimate goal of complete liberation from
suʃering, rather than for stops along the way such as economic prosperity and
political power. However, 99 per cent of Buddhists did not attain nirvana, and
even if they hoped to do so in some future lifetime, they devoted most of their
present lives to the pursuit of mundane achievements. So they continued to
worship various gods, such as the Hindu gods in India, the Bon gods in Tibet, and

the Shinto gods in Japan.
Moreover, as time went by several Buddhist sects developed pantheons of
Buddhas and bodhisattvas. These are human and non-human beings with the
capacity to achieve full liberation from suffering but who forego this liberation out
of compassion, in order to help the countless beings still trapped in the cycle of
misery. Instead of worshipping gods, many Buddhists began worshipping these
enlightened beings, asking them for help not only in attaining nirvana, but also in
dealing with mundane problems. Thus we ɹnd many Buddhas and bodhisattvas
throughout East Asia who spend their time bringing rain, stopping plagues, and
even winning bloody wars – in exchange for prayers, colourful ɻowers, fragrant
incense and gifts of rice and candy.

The Worship of Man

The last 300 years are often depicted as an age of growing secularism, in which
religions have increasingly lost their importance. If we are talking about theist
religions, this is largely correct. But if we take into consideration natural-law
religions, then modernity turns out to be an age of intense religious fervour,
unparalleled missionary eʃorts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The
modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such
as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do
not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just
a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is
founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a
religion than Islam.
Islam is of course diʃerent from Communism, because Islam sees the
superhuman order governing the world as the edict of an omnipotent creator god,
whereas Soviet Communism did not believe in gods. But Buddhism too gives short
shrift to gods, and yet we commonly classify it as a religion. Like Buddhists,
Communists believed in a superhuman order of natural and immutable laws that
should guide human actions. Whereas Buddhists believe that the law of nature was
discovered by Siddhartha Gautama, Communists believed that the law of nature
was discovered by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The
similarity does not end there. Like other religions, Communism too has its holy
scripts and prophetic books, such as Marx’s Das Kapital, which foretold that history
would soon end with the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Communism had its
holidays and festivals, such as the First of May and the anniversary of the October
Revolution. It had theologians adept at Marxist dialectics, and every unit in the

Soviet army had a chaplain, called a commissar, who monitored the piety of
soldiers and oɽcers. Communism had martyrs, holy wars and heresies, such as
Trotskyism. Soviet Communism was a fanatical and missionary religion. A devout
Communist could not be a Christian or a Buddhist, and was expected to spread the
gospel of Marx and Lenin even at the price of his or her life.

Religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order. The
theory of relativity is not a religion, because (at least so far) there are no human norms and values that
are founded on it. Football is not a religion because nobody argues that its rules reflect superhuman
edicts. Islam, Buddhism and Communism are all religions, because all are systems of human norms and
values that are founded on belief in a superhuman order. (Note the difference between ‘superhuman’ and
‘supernatural’. The Buddhist law of nature and the Marxist laws of history are superhuman, since they

were not legislated by humans. Yet they are not supernatural.)

Some readers may feel very uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. If it
makes you feel better, you are free to go on calling Communism an ideology

rather than a religion. It makes no diʃerence. We can divide creeds into god-
centred religions and godless ideologies that claim to be based on natural laws.

But then, to be consistent, we would need to catalogue at least some Buddhist,
Daoist and Stoic sects as ideologies rather than religions. Conversely, we should
note that belief in gods persists within many modern ideologies, and that some of
them, most notably liberalism, make little sense without this belief.

*

It would be impossible to survey here the history of all the new modern creeds,

especially because there are no clear boundaries between them. They are no less
syncretic than monotheism and popular Buddhism. Just as a Buddhist could
worship Hindu deities, and just as a monotheist could believe in the existence of
Satan, so the typical American nowadays is simultaneously a nationalist (she
believes in the existence of an American nation with a special role to play in
history), a free-market capitalist (she believes that open competition and the
pursuit of self-interest are the best ways to create a prosperous society), and a
liberal humanist (she believes that humans have been endowed by their creator
with certain inalienable rights). Nationalism will be discussed in Chapter 18.
Capitalism – the most successful of the modern religions – gets a whole chapter,
Chapter 16, which expounds its principal beliefs and rituals. In the remaining
pages of this chapter I will address the humanist religions.
Theist religions focus on the worship of gods. Humanist religions worship
humanity, or more correctly, Homo sapiens. Humanism is a belief that Homo
sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is fundamentally diʃerent from the
nature of all other animals and of all other phenomena. Humanists believe that
the unique nature of Homo sapiens is the most important thing in the world, and it
determines the meaning of everything that happens in the universe. The supreme
good is the good of Homo sapiens. The rest of the world and all other beings exist
solely for the benefit of this species.
All humanists worship humanity, but they do not agree on its deɹnition.
Humanism has split into three rival sects that ɹght over the exact deɹnition of
‘humanity’, just as rival Christian sects fought over the exact deɹnition of God.
Today, the most important humanist sect is liberal humanism, which believes that
‘humanity’ is a quality of individual humans, and that the liberty of individuals is
therefore sacrosanct. According to liberals, the sacred nature of humanity resides
within each and every individual Homo sapiens. The inner core of individual
humans gives meaning to the world, and is the source for all ethical and political
authority. If we encounter an ethical or political dilemma, we should look inside
and listen to our inner voice – the voice of humanity. The chief commandments of
liberal humanism are meant to protect the liberty of this inner voice against
intrusion or harm. These commandments are collectively known as ‘human rights’.
This, for example, is why liberals object to torture and the death penalty. In
early modern Europe, murderers were thought to violate and destabilise the
cosmic order. To bring the cosmos back to balance, it was necessary to torture and
publicly execute the criminal, so that everyone could see the order re-established.
Attending gruesome executions was a favourite pastime for Londoners and
Parisians in the era of Shakespeare and Molière. In today’s Europe, murder is seen

as a violation of the sacred nature of humanity. In order to restore order, present-
day Europeans do not torture and execute criminals. Instead, they punish a

murderer in what they see as the most ‘humane’ way possible, thus safeguarding
and even rebuilding his human sanctity. By honouring the human nature of the
murderer, everyone is reminded of the sanctity of humanity, and order is restored.
By defending the murderer, we right what the murderer has wronged.
Even though liberal humanism sanctiɹes humans, it does not deny the existence
of God, and is, in fact, founded on monotheist beliefs. The liberal belief in the free
and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the traditional Christian
belief in free and eternal individual souls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a
Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly diɽcult for liberals to explain what is so
special about individual Sapiens.
Another important sect is socialist humanism. Socialists believe that ‘humanity’
is collective rather than individualistic. They hold as sacred not the inner voice of
each individual, but the species Homo sapiens as a whole. Whereas liberal
humanism seeks as much freedom as possible for individual humans, socialist
humanism seeks equality between all humans. According to socialists, inequality is
the worst blasphemy against the sanctity of humanity, because it privileges
peripheral qualities of humans over their universal essence. For example, when
the rich are privileged over the poor, it means that we value money more than the
universal essence of all humans, which is the same for rich and poor alike.
Like liberal humanism, socialist humanism is built on monotheist foundations.
The idea that all humans are equal is a revamped version of the monotheist
conviction that all souls are equal before God. The only humanist sect that has
actually broken loose from traditional monotheism is evolutionary humanism,
whose most famous representatives are the Nazis. What distinguished the Nazis
from other humanist sects was a diʃerent deɹnition of ‘humanity’, one deeply
inɻuenced by the theory of evolution. In contrast to other humanists, the Nazis
believed that humankind is not something universal and eternal, but rather a
mutable species that can evolve or degenerate. Man can evolve into superman, or
degenerate into a subhuman.
The main ambition of the Nazis was to protect humankind from degeneration
and encourage its progressive evolution. This is why the Nazis said that the Aryan
race, the most advanced form of humanity, had to be protected and fostered,
while degenerate kinds of Homo sapiens like Jews, Roma, homosexuals and the
mentally ill had to be quarantined and even exterminated. The Nazis explained
tha t Homo sapiens itself appeared when one ‘superior’ population of ancient
humans evolved, whereas ‘inferior’ populations such as the Neanderthals became
extinct. These diʃerent populations were at ɹrst no more than diʃerent races, but
developed independently along their own evolutionary paths. This might well
happen again. According to the Nazis, Homo sapiens had already divided into
several distinct races, each with its own unique qualities. One of these races, the

Aryan race, had the ɹnest qualities – rationalism, beauty, integrity, diligence. The
Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman. Other races,
such as Jews and blacks, were today’s Neanderthals, possessing inferior qualities.
If allowed to breed, and in particular to intermarry with Aryans, they would
adulterate all human populations and doom Homo sapiens to extinction.
Biologists have since debunked Nazi racial theory. In particular, genetic
research conducted after 1945 has demonstrated that the diʃerences between the
various human lineages are far smaller than the Nazis postulated. But these
conclusions are relatively new. Given the state of scientiɹc knowledge in 1933,
Nazi beliefs were hardly outside the pale. The existence of diʃerent human races,
the superiority of the white race, and the need to protect and cultivate this
superior race were widely held beliefs among most Western elites. Scholars in the
most prestigious Western universities, using the orthodox scientiɹc methods of the
day, published studies that allegedly proved that members of the white race were
more intelligent, more ethical and more skilled than Africans or Indians.
Politicians in Washington, London and Canberra took it for granted that it was
their job to prevent the adulteration and degeneration of the white race, by, for
example, restricting immigration from China or even Italy to ‘Aryan’ countries
such as the USA and Australia.

protect humankind from

to encourage its evolution into
superhumans.

These positions did not change simply because new scientiɹc research was
published. Sociological and political developments were far more powerful
engines of change. In this sense, Hitler dug not just his own grave but that of
racism in general. When he launched World War Two, he compelled his enemies
to make clear distinctions between ‘us’ and ‘them’. Afterwards, precisely because
Nazi ideology was so racist, racism became discredited in the West. But the change
took time. White supremacy remained a mainstream ideology in American politics
at least until the 1960s. The White Australia policy which restricted immigration of
non-white people to Australia remained in force until 1973. Aboriginal Australians
did not receive equal political rights until the 1960s, and most were prevented
from voting in elections because they were deemed unfit to function as citizens.

30. A Nazi propaganda poster showing on the right a ‘racially pure Aryan’ and on the left a ‘cross-breed’.
Nazi admiration for the human body is evident, as is their fear that the lower races might pollute

humanity and cause its degeneration.

The Nazis did not loathe humanity. They fought liberal humanism, human rights
and Communism precisely because they admired humanity and believed in the
great potential of the human species. But following the logic of Darwinian

evolution, they argued that natural selection must be allowed to weed out unɹt
individuals and leave only the ɹttest to survive and reproduce. By succouring the
weak, liberalism and Communism not only allowed unɹt individuals to survive,
they actually gave them the opportunity to reproduce, thereby undermining
natural selection. In such a world, the ɹttest humans would inevitably drown in a
sea of unɹt degenerates. Humankind would become less and less ɹt with each
passing generation – which could lead to its extinction.

31. A Nazi cartoon of 1933. Hitler is presented as a sculptor who creates the superman. A bespectacled
liberal intellectual is appalled by the violence needed to create the superman. (Note also the erotic

glorification of the human body.)

A 1942 German biology textbook explains in the chapter ‘The Laws of Nature
and Mankind’ that the supreme law of nature is that all beings are locked in a
remorseless struggle for survival. After describing how plants struggle for
territory, how beetles struggle to ɹnd mates and so forth, the textbook concludes
that:
The battle for existence is hard and unforgiving, but is the only way to maintain life. This struggle eliminates
everything that is unɹt for life, and selects everything that is able to survive ... These natural laws are
incontrovertible; living creatures demonstrate them by their very survival. They are unforgiving. Those who resist

them will be wiped out. Biology not only tells us about animals and plants, but also shows us the laws we must
follow in our lives, and steels our wills to live and ɹght according to these laws. The meaning of life is struggle.
Woe to him who sins against these laws.
Then follows a quotation from Mein Kampf: ‘The person who attempts to ɹght the
iron logic of nature thereby ɹghts the principles he must thank for his life as a
human being. To fight against nature is to bring about one’s own destruction.’3

At the dawn of the third millennium, the future of evolutionary humanism is
unclear. For sixty years after the end of the war against Hitler it was taboo to link
humanism with evolution and to advocate using biological methods to upgrade’
Homo sapiens. But today such projects are back in vogue. No one speaks about
exterminating lower races or inferior people, but many contemplate using our
increasing knowledge of human biology to create superhumans.
At the same time, a huge gulf is opening between the tenets of liberal humanism
and the latest ɹndings of the life sciences, a gulf we cannot ignore much longer.
Our liberal political and judicial systems are founded on the belief that every
individual has a sacred inner nature, indivisible and immutable, which gives
meaning to the world, and which is the source of all ethical and political
authority. This is a reincarnation of the traditional Christian belief in a free and
eternal soul that resides within each individual. Yet over the last 200 years, the
life sciences have thoroughly undermined this belief. Scientists studying the inner
workings of the human organism have found no soul there. They increasingly
argue that human behaviour is determined by hormones, genes and synapses,
rather than by free will – the same forces that determine the behaviour of
chimpanzees, wolves, and ants. Our judicial and political systems largely try to
sweep such inconvenient discoveries under the carpet. But in all frankness, how
long can we maintain the wall separating the department of biology from the
departments of law and political science?

The Secret of Success

COMMERCE, EMPIRES AND UNIVERSAL religions eventually brought virtually
every Sapiens on every continent into the global world we live in today. Not that
this process of expansion and uniɹcation was linear or without interruptions.
Looking at the bigger picture, though, the transition from many small cultures to a
few large cultures and finally to a single global society was probably an inevitable
result of the dynamics of human history.
But saying that a global society is inevitable is not the same as saying that the
end result had to be the particular kind of global society we now have. We can
certainly imagine other outcomes. Why is English so widespread today, and not
Danish? Why are there about 2 billion Christians and 1.25 billion Muslims, but
only 150,000 Zoroastrians and no Manichaeans? If we could go back in time to
10,000 years ago and set the process going again, time after time, would we
always see the rise of monotheism and the decline of dualism?
We can’t do such an experiment, so we don’t really know. But an examination
of two crucial characteristics of history can provide us with some clues.

1. The Hindsight Fallacy

Every point in history is a crossroads. A single travelled road leads from the past
to the present, but myriad paths fork oʃ into the future. Some of those paths are
wider, smoother and better marked, and are thus more likely to be taken, but
sometimes history – or the people who make history – takes unexpected turns.
At the beginning of the fourth century AD, the Roman Empire faced a wide
horizon of religious possibilities. It could have stuck to its traditional and
variegated polytheism. But its emperor, Constantine, looking back on a fractious
century of civil war, seems to have thought that a single religion with a clear
doctrine could help unify his ethnically diverse realm. He could have chosen any
of a number of contemporary cults to be his national faith – Manichaeism,
Mithraism, the cults of Isis or Cybele, Zoroastrianism, Judaism and even Buddhism

were all available options. Why did he opt for Jesus? Was there something in
Christian theology that attracted him personally, or perhaps an aspect of the faith
that made him think it would be easier to use for his purposes? Did he have a
religious experience, or did some of his advisers suggest that the Christians were
quickly gaining adherents and that it would be best to jump on that wagon?
Historians can speculate, but not provide any deɹnitive answer. They can describe
how Christianity took over the Roman Empire, but they cannot explain why this
particular possibility was realised.
What is the diʃerence between describing ‘how’ and explaining ‘why’? To
describe ‘how’ means to reconstruct the series of speciɹc events that led from one
point to another. To explain ‘why means to ɹnd causal connections that account
for the occurrence of this particular series of events to the exclusion of all others.
Some scholars do indeed provide deterministic explanations of events such as
the rise of Christianity. They attempt to reduce human history to the workings of
biological, ecological or economic forces. They argue that there was something
about the geography, genetics or economy of the Roman Mediterranean that made
the rise of a monotheist religion inevitable. Yet most historians tend to be
sceptical of such deterministic theories. This is one of the distinguishing marks of
history as an academic discipline – the better you know a particular historical
period, the harder it becomes to explain why things happened one way and not
another. Those who have only a superɹcial knowledge of a certain period tend to
focus only on the possibility that was eventually realised. They offer a just-so story
to explain with hindsight why that outcome was inevitable. Those more deeply
informed about the period are much more cognisant of the roads not taken.
In fact, the people who knew the period best – those alive at the time – were the
most clueless of all. For the average Roman in Constantine’s time, the future was
a fog. It is an iron rule of history that what looks inevitable in hindsight was far
from obvious at the time. Today is no diʃerent. Are we out of the global economic
crisis, or is the worst still to come? Will China continue growing until it becomes
the leading superpower? Will the United States lose its hegemony? Is the upsurge
of monotheistic fundamentalism the wave of the future or a local whirlpool of
little long-term signiɹcance? Are we heading towards ecological disaster or
technological paradise? There are good arguments to be made for all of these
outcomes, but no way of knowing for sure. In a few decades, people will look
back and think that the answers to all of these questions were obvious.
It is particularly important to stress that possibilities which seem very unlikely
to contemporaries often get realised. When Constantine assumed the throne in
306, Christianity was little more than an esoteric Eastern sect. If you were to
suggest then that it was about to become the Roman state religion, you’d have
been laughed out of the room just as you would be today if you were to suggest

that by the year 2050 Hare Krishna would be the state religion of the USA. In
October 1913, the Bolsheviks were a small radical Russian faction. No reasonable
person would have predicted that within a mere four years they would take over
the country. In AD 600, the notion that a band of desert-dwelling Arabs would soon
conquer an expanse stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to India was even more
preposterous. Indeed, had the Byzantine army been able to repel the initial
onslaught, Islam would probably have remained an obscure cult of which only a
handful of cognoscenti were aware. Scholars would then have a very easy job
explaining why a faith based on a revelation to a middle-aged Meccan merchant
could never have caught on.
Not that everything is possible. Geographical, biological and economic forces
create constraints. Yet these constraints leave ample room for surprising
developments, which do not seem bound by any deterministic laws.
This conclusion disappoints many people, who prefer history to be
deterministic. Determinism is appealing because it implies that our world and our
beliefs are a natural and inevitable product of history. It is natural and inevitable
that we live in nation states, organise our economy along capitalist principles,
and fervently believe in human rights. To acknowledge that history is not
deterministic is to acknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today
believe in nationalism, capitalism and human rights.
History cannot be explained deterministically and it cannot be predicted
because it is chaotic. So many forces are at work and their interactions are so
complex that extremely small variations in the strength of the forces and the way
they interact produce huge diʃerences in outcomes. Not only that, but history is
what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system. Chaotic systems come in two shapes.
Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather,
for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is inɻuenced by myriad
factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into
consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts.
Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can
never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic
system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with
100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately
react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise. If the current
price of oil is $90 a barrel, and the infallible computer program predicts that
tomorrow it will be $100, traders will rush to buy oil so that they can proɹt from
the predicted price rise. As a result, the price will shoot up to $100 a barrel today
rather than tomorrow. Then what will happen tomorrow? Nobody knows.
Politics, too, is a second-order chaotic system. Many people criticise
Sovietologists for failing to predict the 1989 revolutions and castigate Middle East

experts for not anticipating the Arab Spring revolutions of 2011. This is unfair.
Revolutions are, by deɹnition, unpredictable. A predictable revolution never
erupts.
Why not? Imagine that it’s 2010 and some genius political scientists in cahoots
with a computer wizard have developed an infallible algorithm that, incorporated
into an attractive interface, can be marketed as a revolution predictor. They oʃer
their services to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and, in return for a generous
down payment, tell Mubarak that according to their forecasts a revolution would
certainly break out in Egypt during the course of the following year. How would
Mubarak react? Most likely, he would immediately lower taxes, distribute billions
of dollars in handouts to the citizenry – and also beef up his secret police force,
just in case. The pre-emptive measures work. The year comes and goes and,
surprise, there is no revolution. Mubarak demands his money back. ‘Your
algorithm is worthless!’ he shouts at the scientists. ‘In the end I could have built
another palace instead of giving all that money away!’ ‘But the reason the
revolution didn’t happen is because we predicted it,’ the scientists say in their
defence. ‘Prophets who predict things that don’t happen?’ Mubarak remarks as he
motions his guards to grab them. ‘I could have picked up a dozen of those for next
to nothing in the Cairo marketplace.’
So why study history? Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for
making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen
our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor
inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than
we imagine. For example, studying how Europeans came to dominate Africans
enables us to realise that there is nothing natural or inevitable about the racial
hierarchy, and that the world might well be arranged differently.

2. Blind Clio

We cannot explain the choices that history makes, but we can say something very
important about them: history’s choices are not made for the beneɹt of humans.
There is absolutely no proof that human well-being inevitably improves as history
rolls along. There is no proof that cultures that are beneɹcial to humans must
inexorably succeed and spread, while less beneɹcial cultures disappear. There is
no proof that Christianity was a better choice than Manichaeism, or that the Arab
Empire was more beneficial than that of the Sassanid Persians.
There is no proof that history is working for the beneɹt of humans because we
lack an objective scale on which to measure such beneɹt. Diʃerent cultures deɹne

the good diʃerently, and we have no objective yardstick by which to judge
between them. The victors, of course, always believe that their deɹnition is
correct. But why should we believe the victors? Christians believe that the victory
of Christianity over Manichaeism was beneɹcial to humankind, but if we do not
accept the Christian world view then there is no reason to agree with them.
Muslims believe that the fall of the Sassanid Empire into Muslim hands was
beneɹcial to humankind. But these beneɹts are evident only if we accept the
Muslim world view. It may well be that we’d all be better oʃ if Christianity and
Islam had been forgotten or defeated.
Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with
humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the
body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding
oʃ their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the
hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition
of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They
multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts
and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea – such as belief in Christian
heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth – can compel a
human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death.
The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not
conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as
Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge
accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them.
This approach is sometimes called memetics. It assumes that, just as organic
evolution is based on the replication of organic information units called ‘genes’, so
cultural evolution is based on the replication of cultural information units called
‘memes’.1 Successful cultures are those that excel in reproducing their memes,
irrespective of the costs and benefits to their human hosts.
Most scholars in the humanities disdain memetics, seeing it as an amateurish
attempt to explain cultural processes with crude biological analogies. But many of
these same scholars adhere to memetics’ twin sister – postmodernism.
Postmodernist thinkers speak about discourses rather than memes as the building
blocks of culture. Yet they too see cultures as propagating themselves with little
regard for the beneɹt of humankind. For example, postmodernist thinkers describe
nationalism as a deadly plague that spread throughout the world in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries, causing wars, oppression, hate and genocide. The
moment people in one country were infected with it, those in neighbouring
countries were also likely to catch the virus. The nationalist virus presented itself
as being beneficial for humans, yet it has been beneficial mainly to itself.
Similar arguments are common in the social sciences, under the aegis of game

theory. Game theory explains how in multi-player systems, views and behaviour
patterns that harm all players nevertheless manage to take root and spread. Arms
races are a famous example. Many arms races bankrupt all those who take part in
them, without really changing the military balance of power. When Pakistan buys
advanced aeroplanes, India responds in kind. When India develops nuclear
bombs, Pakistan follows suit. When Pakistan enlarges its navy, India counters. At
the end of the process, the balance of power may remain much as it was, but
meanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in education or health
are spent on weapons. Yet the arms race dynamic is hard to resist. ‘Arms racing’ is
a pattern of behaviour that spreads itself like a virus from one country to another,
harming everyone, but beneɹting itself, under the evolutionary criteria of survival
and reproduction. (Keep in mind that an arms race, like a gene, has no awareness
– it does not consciously seek to survive and reproduce. Its spread is the
unintended result of a powerful dynamic.)
No matter what you call it – game theory, postmodernism or memetics – the
dynamics of history are not directed towards enhancing human well-being. There
is no basis for thinking that the most successful cultures in history are necessarily
the best ones for Homo sapiens. Like evolution, history disregards the happiness of
individual organisms. And individual humans, for their part, are usually far too
ignorant and weak to influence the course of history to their own advantage.

History proceeds from one junction to the next, choosing for some mysterious
reason to follow ɹrst this path, then another. Around AD 1500, history made its
most momentous choice, changing not only the fate of humankind, but arguably
the fate of all life on earth. We call it the Scientiɹc Revolution. It began in
western Europe, a large peninsula on the western tip of Afro-Asia, which up till
then played no important role in history. Why did the Scientiɹc Revolution begin
there of all places, and not in China or India? Why did it begin at the midpoint of
the second millennium AD rather than two centuries before or three centuries later?
We don’t know. Scholars have proposed dozens of theories, but none of them is
particularly convincing.
History has a very wide horizon of possibilities, and many possibilities are never
realised. It is conceivable to imagine history going on for generations upon
generations while bypassing the Scientiɹc Revolution, just as it is conceivable to
imagine history without Christianity, without a Roman Empire, and without gold
coins.

Part Four

The Scientific Revolution

32. Alamogordo, 16 July 1945, 05:29:53. Eight seconds after the first atomic bomb was detonated. The
nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer, upon seeing the explosion, quoted from the Bhagavadgita: ‘Now I

am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’

The Discovery of Ignorance

WERE, SAY, A SPANISH PEASANT TO HAVE fallen asleep in AD 1000 and woken
up 500 years later, to the din of Columbus’ sailors boarding the Niña, Pinta and
Santa Maria, the world would have seemed to him quite familiar. Despite many
changes in technology, manners and political boundaries, this medieval Rip Van
Winkle would have felt at home. But had one of Columbus’ sailors fallen into a
similar slumber and woken up to the ringtone of a twenty-ɹrst-century iPhone, he
would have found himself in a world strange beyond comprehension. ‘Is this
heaven?’ he might well have asked himself. ‘Or perhaps – hell?’
The last 500 years have witnessed a phenomenal and unprecedented growth in
human power. In the year 1500, there were about 500 million Homo sapiens in the
entire world. Today, there are 7 billion.1 The total value of goods and services
produced by humankind in the year 1500 is estimated at $250 billion, in today’s
dollars.2 Nowadays the value of a year of human production is close to $60
trillion.3 In 1500, humanity consumed about 13 trillion calories of energy per day.
Today, we consume 1,500 trillion calories a day.4 (Take a second look at those
ɹgures – human population has increased fourteen-fold, production 240-fold, and
energy consumption 115-fold.)
Suppose a single modern battleship got transported back to Columbus’ time. In
a matter of seconds it could make driftwood out of the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria
and then sink the navies of every great world power of the time without
sustaining a scratch. Five modern freighters could have taken onboard all the
cargo borne by the whole world’s merchant ɻeets.5 A modern computer could
easily store every word and number in all the codex books and scrolls in every
single medieval library with room to spare. Any large bank today holds more
money than all the world’s premodern kingdoms put together.6
In 1500, few cities had more than 100,000 inhabitants. Most buildings were
constructed of mud, wood and straw; a three-storey building was a skyscraper.
The streets were rutted dirt tracks, dusty in summer and muddy in winter, plied by
pedestrians, horses, goats, chickens and a few carts. The most common urban
noises were human and animal voices, along with the occasional hammer and
saw. At sunset, the cityscape went black, with only an occasional candle or torch

ɻickering in the gloom. If an inhabitant of such a city could see modern Tokyo,
New York or Mumbai, what would she think?
Prior to the sixteenth century, no human had circumnavigated the earth. This
changed in 1522, when Magellan’s expedition returned to Spain after a journey of
72,000 kilometres. It took three years and cost the lives of almost all the crew
members, Magellan included. In 1873, Jules Verne could imagine that Phileas
Fogg, a wealthy British adventurer, might just be able to make it around the world
in eighty days. Today anyone with a middle-class income can safely and easily
circumnavigate the globe in just forty-eight hours.
In 1500, humans were conɹned to the earth’s surface. They could build towers
and climb mountains, but the sky was reserved for birds, angels and deities. On 20
July 1969 humans landed on the moon. This was not merely a historical
achievement, but an evolutionary and even cosmic feat. During the previous 4
billion years of evolution, no organism managed even to leave the earth’s
atmosphere, and certainly none left a foot or tentacle print on the moon.
For most of history, humans knew nothing about 99.99 per cent of the
organisms on the planet – namely, the microorganisms. This was not because they
were of no concern to us. Each of us bears billions of one-celled creatures within
us, and not just as free-riders. They are our best friends, and deadliest enemies.
Some of them digest our food and clean our guts, while others cause illnesses and
epidemics. Yet it was only in 1674 that a human eye ɹrst saw a microorganism,
when Anton van Leeuwenhoek took a peek through his home-made microscope
and was startled to see an entire world of tiny creatures milling about in a drop of
water. During the subsequent 300 years, humans have made the acquaintance of a
huge number of microscopic species. We’ve managed to defeat most of the
deadliest contagious diseases they cause, and have harnessed microorganisms in
the service of medicine and industry. Today we engineer bacteria to produce
medications, manufacture biofuel and kill parasites.
But the single most remarkable and deɹning moment of the past 500 years
came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second, American scientists
detonated the ɹrst atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point
onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history,
but to end it.

The historical process that led to Alamogordo and to the moon is known as the
Scientiɹc Revolution. During this revolution humankind has obtained enormous
new powers by investing resources in scientiɹc research. It is a revolution
because, until about AD 1500, humans the world over doubted their ability to
obtain new medical, military and economic powers. While government and
wealthy patrons allocated funds to education and scholarship, the aim was, in

general, to preserve existing capabilities rather than acquire new ones. The
typical premodern ruler gave money to priests, philosophers and poets in the hope
that they would legitimise his rule and maintain the social order. He did not
expect them to discover new medications, invent new weapons or stimulate
economic growth.
During the last ɹve centuries, humans increasingly came to believe that they
could increase their capabilities by investing in scientiɹc research. This wasn’t just
blind faith – it was repeatedly proven empirically. The more proofs there were,
the more resources wealthy people and governments were willing to put into
science. We would never have been able to walk on the moon, engineer
microorganisms and split the atom without such investments. The US government,
for example, has in recent decades allocated billions of dollars to the study of
nuclear physics. The knowledge produced by this research has made possible the
construction of nuclear power stations, which provide cheap electricity for
American industries, which pay taxes to the US government, which uses some of
these taxes to finance further research in nuclear physics.

The Scientific Revolution’s feedback loop. Science needs more than just research to make progress. It
depends on the mutual reinforcement of science, politics and economics. Political and economic
institutions provide the resources without which scientific research is almost impossible. In return,
scientific research provides new powers that are used, among other things, to obtain new resources,

some of which are reinvested in research.

Why did modern humans develop a growing belief in their ability to obtain new
powers through research? What forged the bond between science, politics and
economics? This chapter looks at the unique nature of modern science in order to
provide part of the answer. The next two chapters examine the formation of the
alliance between science, the European empires and the economics of capitalism.

Ignoramus

Humans have sought to understand the universe at least since the Cognitive
Revolution. Our ancestors put a great deal of time and eʃort into trying to
discover the rules that govern the natural world. But modern science diʃers from
all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways:
a. The willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin
injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know
everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we
know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or
theory is sacred and beyond challenge.
b. The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted
ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by
gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these
observations into comprehensive theories.
c. The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating
theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular
to develop new technologies.
The Scientiɹc Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been
above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the
Scientiɹc Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to
their most important questions.
Premodern traditions of knowledge such as Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and
Confucianism asserted that everything that is important to know about the world
was already known. The great gods, or the one almighty God, or the wise people
of the past possessed all-encompassing wisdom, which they revealed to us in
scriptures and oral traditions. Ordinary mortals gained knowledge by delving into
these ancient texts and traditions and understanding them properly. It was
inconceivable that the Bible, the Qur’an or the Vedas were missing out on a crucial
secret of the universe – a secret that might yet be discovered by ɻesh-and-blood
creatures.
Ancient traditions of knowledge admitted only two kinds of ignorance. First, an
individual might be ignorant of something important. To obtain the necessary
knowledge, all he needed to do was ask somebody wiser. There was no need to
discover something that nobody yet knew. For example, if a peasant in some
thirteenth-century Yorkshire village wanted to know how the human race
originated, he assumed that Christian tradition held the deɹnitive answer. All he

had to do was ask the local priest.
Second, an entire tradition might be ignorant of unimportant things. By deɹnition,
whatever the great gods or the wise people of the past did not bother to tell us
was unimportant. For example, if our Yorkshire peasant wanted to know how
spiders weave their webs, it was pointless to ask the priest, because there was no
answer to this question in any of the Christian Scriptures. That did not mean,
however, that Christianity was deɹcient. Rather, it meant that understanding how
spiders weave their webs was unimportant. After all, God knew perfectly well
how spiders do it. If this were a vital piece of information, necessary for human
prosperity and salvation, God would have included a comprehensive explanation
in the Bible.
Christianity did not forbid people to study spiders. But spider scholars – if there
were any in medieval Europe – had to accept their peripheral role in society and
the irrelevance of their ɹndings to the eternal truths of Christianity. No matter
what a scholar might discover about spiders or butterɻies or Galapagos ɹnches,
that knowledge was little more than trivia, with no bearing on the fundamental
truths of society, politics and economics.
In fact, things were never quite that simple. In every age, even the most pious
and conservative, there were people who argued that there were important things
of which their entire tradition was ignorant. Yet such people were usually
marginalised or persecuted – or else they founded a new tradition and began
arguing that they knew everything there is to know. For example, the prophet
Muhammad began his religious career by condemning his fellow Arabs for living
in ignorance of the divine truth. Yet Muhammad himself very quickly began to
argue that he knew the full truth, and his followers began calling him ‘The Seal of
the Prophets’. Henceforth, there was no need of revelations beyond those given to
Muhammad.
Modern-day science is a unique tradition of knowledge, inasmuch as it openly
admits collective ignorance regarding the most important questions. Darwin never
argued that he was ‘The Seal of the Biologists’, and that he had solved the riddle of
life once and for all. After centuries of extensive scientiɹc research, biologists
admit that they still don’t have any good explanation for how brains produce
consciousness. Physicists admit that they don’t know what caused the Big Bang, or
how to reconcile quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity.
In other cases, competing scientiɹc theories are vociferously debated on the
basis of constantly emerging new evidence. A prime example is the debates about
how best to run the economy. Though individual economists may claim that their

method is the best, orthodoxy changes with every ɹnancial crisis and stock-
exchange bubble, and it is generally accepted that the ɹnal word on economics is

yet to be said.

In still other cases, particular theories are supported so consistently by the
available evidence, that all alternatives have long since fallen by the wayside.
Such theories are accepted as true – yet everyone agrees that were new evidence
to emerge that contradicts the theory, it would have to be revised or discarded.
Good examples of these are the plate tectonics theory and the theory of evolution.
The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic,
supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge. This has hugely
expanded our capacity to understand how the world works and our ability to
invent new technologies. But it presents us with a serious problem that most of
our ancestors did not have to cope with. Our current assumption that we do not
know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to
the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate eʃectively. If the
evidence shows that many of those myths are doubtful, how can we hold society
together? How can our communities, countries and international system function?
All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but
to rely on either of two unscientific methods:
a. Take a scientiɹc theory, and in opposition to common scientiɹc practices,
declare that it is a ɹnal and absolute truth. This was the method used by Nazis
(who claimed that their racial policies were the corollaries of biological facts)
and Communists (who claimed that Marx and Lenin had divined absolute
economic truths that could never be refuted).
b. Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scientiɹc absolute truth.
This has been the strategy of liberal humanism, which is built on a dogmatic
belief in the unique worth and rights of human beings – a doctrine which has
embarrassingly little in common with the scientific study of Homo sapiens.
But that shouldn’t surprise us. Even science itself has to rely on religious and
ideological beliefs to justify and finance its research.
Modern culture has nevertheless been willing to embrace ignorance to a much
greater degree than has any previous culture. One of the things that has made it
possible for modern social orders to hold together is the spread of an almost
religious belief in technology and in the methods of scientiɹc research, which have
replaced to some extent the belief in absolute truths.

The Scientific Dogma

Modern science has no dogma. Yet it has a common core of research methods,

which are all based on collecting empirical observations – those we can observe
with at least one of our senses – and putting them together with the help of
mathematical tools.
People throughout history collected empirical observations, but the importance
of these observations was usually limited. Why waste precious resources obtaining
new observations when we already have all the answers we need? But as modern
people came to admit that they did not know the answers to some very important
questions, they found it necessary to look for completely new knowledge.
Consequently, the dominant modern research method takes for granted the
insuɽciency of old knowledge. Instead of studying old traditions, emphasis is now
placed on new observations and experiments. When present observation collides
with past tradition, we give precedence to the observation. Of course, physicists
analysing the spectra of distant galaxies, archaeologists analysing the ɹnds from a
Bronze Age city, and political scientists studying the emergence of capitalism do
not disregard tradition. They start by studying what the wise people of the past
have said and written. But from their ɹrst year in college, aspiring physicists,
archaeologists and political scientists are taught that it is their mission to go
beyond what Einstein, Heinrich Schliemann and Max Weber ever knew.

Mere observations, however, are not knowledge. In order to understand the
universe, we need to connect observations into comprehensive theories. Earlier
traditions usually formulated their theories in terms of stories. Modern science
uses mathematics.
There are very few equations, graphs and calculations in the Bible, the Qur’an,
the Vedas or the Confucian classics. When traditional mythologies and scriptures
laid down general laws, these were presented in narrative rather than
mathematical form. Thus a fundamental principle of Manichaean religion asserted
that the world is a battleground between good and evil. An evil force created
matter, while a good force created spirit. Humans are caught between these two
forces, and should choose good over evil. Yet the prophet Mani made no attempt
to oʃer a mathematical formula that could be used to predict human choices by
quantifying the respective strength of these two forces. He never calculated that
‘the force acting on a man is equal to the acceleration of his spirit divided by the
mass of his body’.
This is exactly what scientists seek to accomplish. In 1687, Isaac Newton
published The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, arguably the most
important book in modern history. Newton presented a general theory of
movement and change. The greatness of Newton’s theory was its ability to explain
and predict the movements of all bodies in the universe, from falling apples to
shooting stars, using three very simple mathematical laws:

Henceforth, anyone who wished to understand and predict the movement of a
cannonball or a planet simply had to make measurements of the object’s mass,
direction and acceleration, and the forces acting on it. By inserting these numbers
into Newton’s equations, the future position of the object could be predicted. It
worked like magic. Only around the end of the nineteenth century did scientists
come across a few observations that did not ɹt well with Newton’s laws, and these
led to the next revolutions in physics – the theory of relativity and quantum
mechanics.

Newton showed that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics.
Some chapters (for example) boil down to a clear-cut equation; but scholars who
attempted to reduce biology, economics and psychology to neat Newtonian
equations have discovered that these ɹelds have a level of complexity that makes
such an aspiration futile. This did not mean, however, that they gave up on
mathematics. A new branch of mathematics was developed over the last 200 years
to deal with the more complex aspects of reality: statistics.
In 1744, two Presbyterian clergymen in Scotland, Alexander Webster and
Robert Wallace, decided to set up a life-insurance fund that would provide
pensions for the widows and orphans of dead clergymen. They proposed that each
of their church’s ministers would pay a small portion of his income into the fund,
which would invest the money. If a minister died, his widow would receive
dividends on the fund’s proɹts. This would allow her to live comfortably for the
rest of her life. But to determine how much the ministers had to pay in so that the
fund would have enough money to live up to its obligations, Webster and Wallace
had to be able to predict how many ministers would die each year, how many
widows and orphans they would leave behind, and by how many years the
widows would outlive their husbands.
Take note of what the two churchmen did not do. They did not pray to God to
reveal the answer. Nor did they search for an answer in the Holy Scriptures or
among the works of ancient theologians. Nor did they enter into an abstract
philosophical disputation. Being Scots, they were practical types. So they
contacted a professor of mathematics from the University of Edinburgh, Colin

Maclaurin. The three of them collected data on the ages at which people died and
used these to calculate how many ministers were likely to pass away in any given
year.
Their work was founded on several recent breakthroughs in the ɹelds of
statistics and probability. One of these was Jacob Bernoulli’s Law of Large
Numbers. Bernoulli had codiɹed the principle that while it might be diɽcult to
predict with certainty a single event, such as the death of a particular person, it
was possible to predict with great accuracy the average outcome of many similar
events. That is, while Maclaurin could not use maths to predict whether Webster
and Wallace would die next year, he could, given enough data, tell Webster and
Wallace how many Presbyterian ministers in Scotland would almost certainly die
next year. Fortunately, they had ready-made data that they could use. Actuary
tables published ɹfty years previously by Edmond Halley proved particularly
useful. Halley had analysed records of 1,238 births and 1,174 deaths that he
obtained from the city of Breslau, Germany. Halley’s tables made it possible to see
that, for example, a twenty-year-old person has a 1:100 chance of dying in a
given year, but a fifty-year-old person has a 1:39 chance.
Processing these numbers, Webster and Wallace concluded that, on average,
there would be 930 living Scottish Presbyterian ministers at any given moment,
and an average of twenty-seven ministers would die each year, eighteen of whom
would be survived by widows. Five of those who did not leave widows would
leave orphaned children, and two of those survived by widows would also be
outlived by children from previous marriages who had not yet reached the age of
sixteen. They further computed how much time was likely to go by before the
widows’ death or remarriage (in both these eventualities, payment of the pension
would cease). These ɹgures enabled Webster and Wallace to determine how much
money the ministers who joined their fund had to pay in order to provide for their
loved ones. By contributing £2 12s. 2d. a year, a minister could guarantee that his
widowed wife would receive at least £10 a year – a hefty sum in those days. If he
thought that was not enough he could choose to pay in more, up to a level of £6
11s. 3d. a year – which would guarantee his widow the even more handsome sum
of £25 a year.
According to their calculations, by the year 1765 the Fund for a Provision for
the Widows and Children of the Ministers of the Church of Scotland would have
capital totalling £58,348. Their calculations proved amazingly accurate. When
that year arrived, the fund’s capital stood at £58,347 – just £1 less than the
prediction! This was even better than the prophecies of Habakkuk, Jeremiah or St
John. Today, Webster and Wallace’s fund, known simply as Scottish Widows, is
one of the largest pension and insurance companies in the world. With assets
worth £100 billion, it insures not only Scottish widows, but anyone willing to buy

its policies.7
Probability calculations such as those used by the two Scottish ministers became
the foundation not merely of actuarial science, which is central to the pension and
insurance business, but also of the science of demography (founded by another
clergyman, the Anglican Robert Malthus). Demography in its turn was the
cornerstone on which Charles Darwin (who almost became an Anglican pastor)
built his theory of evolution. While there are no equations that predict what kind
of organism will evolve under a speciɹc set of conditions, geneticists use
probability calculations to compute the likelihood that a particular mutation will
spread in a given population. Similar probabilistic models have become central to
economics, sociology, psychology, political science and the other social and
natural sciences. Even physics eventually supplemented Newton’s classical
equations with the probability clouds of quantum mechanics.

We need merely look at the history of education to realise how far this process has
taken us. Throughout most of history, mathematics was an esoteric ɹeld that even
educated people rarely studied seriously. In medieval Europe, logic, grammar and
rhetoric formed the educational core, while the teaching of mathematics seldom
went beyond simple arithmetic and geometry. Nobody studied statistics. The
undisputed monarch of all sciences was theology.
Today few students study rhetoric; logic is restricted to philosophy departments,
and theology to seminaries. But more and more students are motivated – or forced
– to study mathematics. There is an irresistible drift towards the exact sciences –
defined as ‘exact’ by their use of mathematical tools. Even fields of study that were
traditionally part of the humanities, such as the study of human language
(linguistics) and the human psyche (psychology), rely increasingly on
mathematics and seek to present themselves as exact sciences. Statistics courses
are now part of the basic requirements not just in physics and biology, but also in
psychology, sociology, economics and political science.
In the course catalogue of the psychology department at my own university, the
ɹrst required course in the curriculum is ‘Introduction to Statistics and
Methodology in Psychological Research’. Second-year psychology students must
take ‘Statistical Methods in Psychological Research’. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus and
Muhammad would have been bewildered if you told them that in order to
understand the human mind and cure its illnesses you must first study statistics.

Knowledge is Power

Most people have a hard time digesting modern science because its mathematical
language is diɽcult for our minds to grasp, and its ɹndings often contradict
common sense. Out of the 7 billion people in the world, how many really
understand quantum mechanics, cell biology or macroeconomics? Science
nevertheless enjoys immense prestige because of the new powers it gives us.
Presidents and generals may not understand nuclear physics, but they have a good
grasp of what nuclear bombs can do.
In 1620 Francis Bacon published a scientific manifesto tided The New Instrument.
In it he argued that ‘knowledge is power’. The real test of ‘knowledge’ is not
whether it is true, but whether it empowers us. Scientists usually assume that no
theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge.
The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes
knowledge.
Over the centuries, science has oʃered us many new tools. Some are mental
tools, such as those used to predict death rates and economic growth. Even more
important are technological tools. The connection forged between science and
technology is so strong that today people tend to confuse the two. We often think
that it is impossible to develop new technologies without scientiɹc research, and
that there is little point in research if it does not result in new technologies.
In fact, the relationship between science and technology is a very recent
phenomenon. Prior to 1500, science and technology were totally separate ɹelds.
When Bacon connected the two in the early seventeenth century, it was a
revolutionary idea. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries this
relationship tightened, but the knot was tied only in the nineteenth century. Even
in 1800, most rulers who wanted a strong army, and most business magnates who
wanted a successful business, did not bother to finance research in physics, biology
or economics.
I don’t mean to claim that there is no exception to this rule. A good historian
can ɹnd precedent for everything. But an even better historian knows when these
precedents are but curiosities that cloud the big picture. Generally speaking, most
premodern rulers and business people did not ɹnance research about the nature of
the universe in order to develop new technologies, and most thinkers did not try
to translate their ɹndings into technological gadgets. Rulers ɹnanced educational
institutions whose mandate was to spread traditional knowledge for the purpose
of buttressing the existing order.
Here and there people did develop new technologies, but these were usually
created by uneducated craftsmen using trial and error, not by scholars pursuing
systematic scientiɹc research. Cart manufacturers built the same carts from the
same materials year in year out. They did not set aside a percentage of their
annual proɹts in order to research and develop new cart models. Cart design

occasionally improved, but it was usually thanks to the ingenuity of some local
carpenter who never set foot in a university and did not even know how to read.
This was true of the public as well as the private sector. Whereas modern states
call in their scientists to provide solutions in almost every area of national policy,
from energy to health to waste disposal, ancient kingdoms seldom did so. The
contrast between then and now is most pronounced in weaponry. When outgoing
President Dwight Eisenhower warned in 1961 of the growing power of the
military-industrial complex, he left out a part of the equation. He should have
alerted his country to the military-industrial-scientiɹc complex, because today’s
wars are scientiɹc productions. The world’s military forces initiate, fund and steer
a large part of humanity’s scientific research and technological development.
When World War One bogged down into interminable trench warfare, both
sides called in the scientists to break the deadlock and save the nation. The men in
white answered the call, and out of the laboratories rolled a constant stream of
new wonder-weapons: combat aircraft, poison gas, tanks, submarines and ever
more efficient machine guns, artillery pieces, rifles and bombs.

33. German V-2 rocket ready to launch. It didn’t defeat the Allies, but it kept the Germans hoping for a

technological miracle until the very last days of the war.

Science played an even larger role in World War Two. By late 1944 Germany
was losing the war and defeat was imminent. A year earlier, the Germans’ allies,
the Italians, had toppled Mussolini and surrendered to the Allies. But Germany
kept ɹghting on, even though the British, American and Soviet armies were

closing in. One reason German soldiers and civilians thought not all was lost was
that they believed German scientists were about to turn the tide with so-called
miracle weapons such as the V-2 rocket and jet-powered aircraft.
While the Germans were working on rockets and jets, the American Manhattan
Project successfully developed atomic bombs. By the time the bomb was ready, in
early August 1945, Germany had already surrendered, but Japan was ɹghting on.
American forces were poised to invade its home islands. The Japanese vowed to
resist the invasion and ɹght to the death, and there was every reason to believe
that it was no idle threat. American generals told President Harry S. Truman that
an invasion of Japan would cost the lives of a million American soldiers and
would extend the war well into 1946. Truman decided to use the new bomb. Two
weeks and two atom bombs later, Japan surrendered unconditionally and the war
was over.
But science is not just about oʃensive weapons. It plays a major role in our
defences as well. Today many Americans believe that the solution to terrorism is
technological rather than political. Just give millions more to the nanotechnology
industry, they believe, and the United States could send bionic spy-ɻies into every
Afghan cave, Yemenite redoubt and North African encampment. Once that’s done,
Osama Bin Laden’s heirs will not be able to make a cup of coʃee without a CIA
spy-ɻy passing this vital information back to headquarters in Langley. Allocate

millions more to brain research, and every airport could be equipped with ultra-
sophisticated FMRI scanners that could immediately recognise angry and hateful

thoughts in people’s brains. Will it really work? Who knows. Is it wise to develop
bionic ɻies and thought-reading scanners? Not necessarily. Be that as it may, as
you read these lines, the US Department of Defense is transferring millions of
dollars to nanotechnology and brain laboratories for work on these and other such
ideas.
This obsession with military technology – from tanks to atom bombs to spy-ɻies
– is a surprisingly recent phenomenon. Up until the nineteenth century, the vast
majority of military revolutions were the product of organisational rather than
technological changes. When alien civilisations met for the ɹrst time,
technological gaps sometimes played an important role. But even in such cases,
few thought of deliberately creating or enlarging such gaps. Most empires did not
rise thanks to technological wizardry, and their rulers did not give much thought
to technological improvement. The Arabs did not defeat the Sassanid Empire
thanks to superior bows or swords, the Seljuks had no technological advantage
over the Byzantines, and the Mongols did not conquer China with the help of some
ingenious new weapon. In fact, in all these cases the vanquished enjoyed superior
military and civilian technology.
The Roman army is a particularly good example. It was the best army of its day,

yet technologically speaking, Rome had no edge over Carthage, Macedonia or the
Seleucid Empire. Its advantage rested on efficient organisation, iron discipline and
huge manpower reserves. The Roman army never set up a research and
development department, and its weapons remained more or less the same for
centuries on end. If the legions of Scipio Aemilianus – the general who levelled
Carthage and defeated the Numantians in the second century BC – had suddenly
popped up 500 years later in the age of Constantine the Great, Scipio would have
had a fair chance of beating Constantine. Now imagine what would happen to a
general from a few centuries back – say Napoleon – if he led his troops against a
modern armoured brigade. Napoleon was a brilliant tactician, and his men were
crack professionals, but their skills would be useless in the face of modern
weaponry.
As in Rome, so also in ancient China: most generals and philosophers did not
think it their duty to develop new weapons. The most important military
invention in the history of China was gunpowder. Yet to the best of our
knowledge, gunpowder was invented accidentally, by Daoist alchemists searching
for the elixir of life. Gunpowder’s subsequent career is even more telling. One
might have thought that the Daoist alchemists would have made China master of
the world. In fact, the Chinese used the new compound mainly for ɹrecrackers.
Even as the Song Empire collapsed in the face of a Mongol invasion, no emperor
set up a medieval Manhattan Project to save the empire by inventing a doomsday
weapon. Only in the ɹfteenth century – about 600 years after the invention of
gunpowder – did cannons become a decisive factor on Afro-Asian battlefields. Why
did it take so long for the deadly potential of this substance to be put to military
use? Because it appeared at a time when neither kings, scholars, nor merchants
thought that new military technology could save them or make them rich.
The situation began to change in the ɹfteenth and sixteenth centuries, but
another 200 years went by before most rulers evinced any interest in ɹnancing
the research and development of new weapons. Logistics and strategy continued
to have far greater impact on the outcome of wars than technology. The
Napoleonic military machine that crushed the armies of the European powers at
Austerlitz (1805) was armed with more or less the same weaponry that the army
of Louis XVI had used. Napoleon himself, despite being an artilleryman, had little
interest in new weapons, even though scientists and inventors tried to persuade
him to fund the development of flying machines, submarines and rockets.
Science, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of
the capitalist system and the Industrial Revolution. Once this relationship was
established, however, it quickly transformed the world.

The Ideal of Progress

Until the Scientiɹc Revolution most human cultures did not believe in progress.
They thought the golden age was in the past, and that the world was stagnant, if
not deteriorating. Strict adherence to the wisdom of the ages might perhaps bring
back the good old times, and human ingenuity might conceivably improve this or

that facet of daily life. However, it was considered impossible for human know-
how to overcome the world’s fundamental problems. If even Muhammad, Jesus,

Buddha and Confucius – who knew everything there is to know – were unable to
abolish famine, disease, poverty and war from the world, how could we expect to
do so?
Many faiths believed that some day a messiah would appear and end all wars,
famines and even death itself. But the notion that humankind could do so by
discovering new knowledge and inventing new tools was worse than ludicrous – it
was hubris. The story of the Tower of Babel, the story of Icarus, the story of the
Golem and countless other myths taught people that any attempt to go beyond
human limitations would inevitably lead to disappointment and disaster.
When modern culture admitted that there were many important things that it
still did not know, and when that admission of ignorance was married to the idea
that scientiɹc discoveries could give us new powers, people began suspecting that
real progress might be possible after all. As science began to solve one unsolvable
problem after another, many became convinced that humankind could overcome
any and every problem by acquiring and applying new knowledge. Poverty,
sickness, wars, famines, old age and death itself were not the inevitable fate of
humankind. They were simply the fruits of our ignorance.

34. Benjamin Franklin disarming the gods.

A famous example is lightning. Many cultures believed that lightning was the
hammer of an angry god, used to punish sinners. In the middle of the eighteenth
century, in one of the most celebrated experiments in scientiɹc history, Benjamin
Franklin ɻew a kite during a lightning storm to test the hypothesis that lightning
is simply an electric current. Franklins empirical observations, coupled with his
knowledge about the qualities of electrical energy, enabled him to invent the
lightning rod and disarm the gods.
Poverty is another case in point. Many cultures have viewed poverty as an
inescapable part of this imperfect world. According to the New Testament, shortly
before the cruciɹxion a woman anointed Christ with precious oil worth 300
denarii. Jesus’ disciples scolded the woman for wasting such a huge sum of money
instead of giving it to the poor, but Jesus defended her, saying that ‘The poor you
will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you
will not always have me’ (Mark 14:7). Today, fewer and fewer people, including
fewer and fewer Christians, agree with Jesus on this matter. Poverty is
increasingly seen as a technical problem amenable to intervention. It’s common
wisdom that policies based on the latest ɹndings in agronomy, economics,
medicine and sociology can eliminate poverty.
And indeed, many parts of the world have already been freed from the worst
forms of deprivation. Throughout history, societies have suʃered from two kinds
of poverty: social poverty, which withholds from some people the opportunities
available to others; and biological poverty, which puts the very lives of individuals
at risk due to lack of food and shelter. Perhaps social poverty can never be

eradicated, but in many countries around the world biological poverty is a thing
of the past.
Until recently, most people hovered very close to the biological poverty line,
below which a person lacks enough calories to sustain life for long. Even small
miscalculations or misfortunes could easily push people below that line, into
starvation. Natural disasters and man-made calamities often plunged entire
populations over the abyss, causing the death of millions. Today most of the
world’s people have a safety net stretched below them. Individuals are protected
from personal misfortune by insurance, state-sponsored social security and a
plethora of local and international NGOs. When calamity strikes an entire region,
worldwide relief eʃorts are usually successful in preventing the worst. People still
suʃer from numerous degradations, humiliations and poverty-related illnesses, but
in most countries nobody is starving to death. In fact, in many societies more
people are in danger of dying from obesity than from starvation.

The Gilgamesh Project

Of all mankind’s ostensibly insoluble problems, one has remained the most vexing,
interesting and important: the problem of death itself. Before the late modern era,
most religions and ideologies took it for granted that death was our inevitable
fate. Moreover, most faiths turned death into the main source of meaning in life.
Try to imagine Islam, Christianity or the ancient Egyptian religion in a world
without death. These creeds taught people that they must come to terms with
death and pin their hopes on the afterlife, rather than seek to overcome death and
live for ever here on earth. The best minds were busy giving meaning to death,
not trying to escape it.
That is the theme of the most ancient myth to come down to us – the Gilgamesh
myth of ancient Sumer. Its hero is the strongest and most capable man in the
world, King Gilgamesh of Uruk, who could defeat anyone in battle. One day,
Gilgamesh’s best friend, Enkidu, died. Gilgamesh sat by the body and observed it
for many days, until he saw a worm dropping out of his friend’s nostril. At that
moment Gilgamesh was gripped by a terrible horror, and he resolved that he
himself would never die. He would somehow ɹnd a way to defeat death.
Gilgamesh then undertook a journey to the end of the universe, killing lions,
battling scorpion-men and ɹnding his way into the underworld. There he
shattered the stone giants of Urshanabi and the ferryman of the river of the dead,
and found Utnapishtim, the last survivor of the primordial ɻood. Yet Gilgamesh
failed in his quest. He returned home empty-handed, as mortal as ever, but with

one new piece of wisdom. When the gods created man, Gilgamesh had learned,
they set death as man’s inevitable destiny, and man must learn to live with it.
Disciples of progress do not share this defeatist attitude. For men of science,
death is not an inevitable destiny, but merely a technical problem. People die not
because the gods decreed it, but due to various technical failures – a heart attack,
cancer, an infection. And every technical problem has a technical solution. If the
heart ɻutters, it can be stimulated by a pacemaker or replaced by a new heart. If
cancer rampages, it can be killed with drugs or radiation. If bacteria proliferate,
they can be subdued with antibiotics. True, at present we cannot solve all
technical problems. But we are working on them. Our best minds are not wasting
their time trying to give meaning to death. Instead, they are busy investigating
the physiological, hormonal and genetic systems responsible for disease and old
age. They are developing new medicines, revolutionary treatments and artiɹcial
organs that will lengthen our lives and might one day vanquish the Grim Reaper
himself.
Until recently, you would not have heard scientists, or anyone else, speak so
bluntly. ‘Defeat death?! What nonsense! We are only trying to cure cancer,
tuberculosis and Alzheimer’s disease,’ they insisted. People avoided the issue of
death because the goal seemed too elusive. Why create unreasonable
expectations? We’re now at a point, however, where we can be frank about it.
The leading project of the Scientiɹc Revolution is to give humankind eternal life.
Even if killing death seems a distant goal, we have already achieved things that
were inconceivable a few centuries ago. In 1199, King Richard the Lionheart was
struck by an arrow in his left shoulder. Today we’d say he incurred a minor injury.
But in 1199, in the absence of antibiotics and eʃective sterilisation methods, this
minor ɻesh wound turned infected and gangrene set in. The only way to stop the
spread of gangrene in twelfth-century Europe was to cut oʃ the infected limb,
impossible when the infection was in a shoulder. The gangrene spread through the
Lionheart’s body and no one could help the king. He died in great agony two
weeks later.
As recently as the nineteenth century, the best doctors still did not know how to
prevent infection and stop the putrefaction of tissues. In ɹeld hospitals doctors
routinely cut oʃ the hands and legs of soldiers who received even minor limb
injuries, fearing gangrene. These amputations, as well as all other medical
procedures (such as tooth extraction), were done without any anaesthetics. The
ɹrst anaesthetics – ether, chloroform and morphine – entered regular usage in
Western medicine only in the middle of the nineteenth century. Before the advent
of chloroform, four soldiers had to hold down a wounded comrade while the
doctor sawed oʃ the injured limb. On the morning after the battle of Waterloo
(1815), heaps of sawn-oʃ hands and legs could be seen adjacent to the ɹeld

hospitals. In those days, carpenters and butchers who enlisted to the army were
often sent to serve in the medical corps, because surgery required little more than
knowing your way with knives and saws.
In the two centuries since Waterloo, things have changed beyond recognition.
Pills, injections and sophisticated operations save us from a spate of illnesses and
injuries that once dealt an inescapable death sentence. They also protect us
against countless daily aches and ailments, which premodern people simply

accepted as part of life. The average life expectancy jumped from around twenty-
five to forty years, to around sixty-seven in the entire world, and to around eighty

years in the developed world.8
Death suʃered its worst setbacks in the arena of child mortality. Until the
twentieth century, between a quarter and a third of the children of agricultural
societies never reached adulthood. Most succumbed to childhood diseases such as
diphtheria, measles and smallpox. In seventeenth-century England, 150 out of
every 1,000 newborns died during their ɹrst year, and a third of all children were
dead before they reached ɹfteen.9 Today, only ɹve out of 1,000 English babies die
during their first year, and only seven out of 1,000 die before age fifteen.10
We can better grasp the full impact of these ɹgures by setting aside statistics
and telling some stories. A good example is the family of King Edward I of
England (1237–1307) and his wife, Queen Eleanor (1241–90). Their children
enjoyed the best conditions and the most nurturing surroundings that could be
provided in medieval Europe. They lived in palaces, ate as much food as they
liked, had plenty of warm clothing, well-stocked ɹreplaces, the cleanest water
available, an army of servants and the best doctors. The sources mention sixteen
children that Queen Eleanor bore between 1255 and 1284:
1. An anonymous daughter, born in 1255, died at birth.
2. A daughter, Catherine, died either at age one or age three.
3. A daughter, Joan, died at six months.
4. A son, John, died at age five.
5. A son, Henry, died at age six.
6. A daughter, Eleanor, died at age twenty-nine.
7. An anonymous daughter died at five months.
8. A daughter, Joan, died at age thirty-five.
9. A son, Alphonso, died at age ten.
10. A daughter, Margaret, died at age fifty-eight.

11. A daughter, Berengeria, died at age two.
12. An anonymous daughter died shortly after birth.
13. A daughter, Mary, died at age fifty-three.
14. An anonymous son died shortly after birth.
15. A daughter, Elizabeth, died at age thirty-four.
16. A son, Edward.

The youngest, Edward, was the ɹrst of the boys to survive the dangerous years of
childhood, and at his fathers death he ascended the English throne as King Edward
II. In other words, it took Eleanor sixteen tries to carry out the most fundamental
mission of an English queen – to provide her husband with a male heir. Edward
II’s mother must have been a woman of exceptional patience and fortitude. Not so
the woman Edward chose for his wife, Isabella of France. She had him murdered
when he was forty-three.11
To the best of our knowledge, Eleanor and Edward I were a healthy couple and
passed no fatal hereditary illnesses on to their children. Nevertheless, ten out of
the sixteen – 62 per cent – died during childhood. Only six managed to live beyond
the age of eleven, and only three – just 18 per cent – lived beyond the age of
forty. In addition to these births, Eleanor most likely had a number of pregnancies
that ended in miscarriage. On average, Edward and Eleanor lost a child every
three years, ten children one after another. It’s nearly impossible for a parent
today to imagine such loss.
How long will the Gilgamesh Project – the quest for immortality – take to
complete? A hundred years? Five hundred years? A thousand years? When we
recall how little we knew about the human body in 1900, and how much
knowledge we have gained in a single century, there is cause for optimism.
Genetic engineers have recently managed to double the average life expectancy of
Caenorhabditis elegans worms.12 Could they do the same for Homo sapiens?
Nanotechnology experts are developing a bionic immune system composed of
millions of nano-robots, who would inhabit our bodies, open blocked blood
vessels, ɹght viruses and bacteria, eliminate cancerous cells and even reverse
ageing processes.13 A few serious scholars suggest that by 2050, some humans will
become a-mortal (not immortal, because they could still die of some accident, but
a-mortal, meaning that in the absence of fatal trauma their lives could be
extended indefinitely).
Whether or not Project Gilgamesh succeeds, from a historical perspective it is

fascinating to see that most late-modern religions and ideologies have already
taken death and the afterlife out of the equation. Until the eighteenth century,
religions considered death and its aftermath central to the meaning of life.
Beginning in the eighteenth century, religions and ideologies such as liberalism,
socialism and feminism lost all interest in the afterlife. What, exactly, happens to
a Communist after he or she dies? What happens to a capitalist? What happens to
a feminist? It is pointless to look for the answer in the writings of Marx, Adam
Smith or Simone de Beauvoir. The only modern ideology that still awards death a
central role is nationalism. In its more poetic and desperate moments, nationalism
promises that whoever dies for the nation will forever live in its collective
memory. Yet this promise is so fuzzy that even most nationalists do not really
know what to make of it.

The Sugar Daddy of Science

We are living in a technical age. Many are convinced that science and technology
hold the answers to all our problems. We should just let the scientists and
technicians go on with their work, and they will create heaven here on earth. But
science is not an enterprise that takes place on some superior moral or spiritual
plane above the rest of human activity. Like all other parts of our culture, it is
shaped by economic, political and religious interests.
Science is a very expensive aʃair. A biologist seeking to understand the human
immune system requires laboratories, test tubes, chemicals and electron
microscopes, not to mention lab assistants, electricians, plumbers and cleaners. An
economist seeking to model credit markets must buy computers, set up giant
databanks and develop complicated data-processing programs. An archaeologist
who wishes to understand the behaviour of archaic hunter-gatherers must travel to
distant lands, excavate ancient ruins and date fossilised bones and artefacts. All of
this costs money.
During the past 500 years modern science has achieved wonders thanks largely
to the willingness of governments, businesses, foundations and private donors to
channel billions of dollars into scientiɹc research. These billions have done much
more to chart the universe, map the planet and catalogue the animal kingdom
than did Galileo Galilei, Christopher Columbus and Charles Darwin. If these
particular geniuses had never been born, their insights would probably have
occurred to others. But if the proper funding were unavailable, no intellectual
brilliance could have compensated for that. If Darwin had never been born, for
example, we’d today attribute the theory of evolution to Alfred Russel Wallace,

who came up with the idea of evolution via natural selection independently of
Darwin and just a few years later. But if the European powers had not ɹnanced
geographical, zoological and botanical research around the world, neither Darwin
nor Wallace would have had the necessary empirical data to develop the theory of
evolution. It is likely that they would not even have tried.
Why did the billions start ɻowing from government and business coʃers into
labs and universities? In academic circles, many are naïve enough to believe in
pure science. They believe that government and business altruistically give them
money to pursue whatever research projects strike their fancy. But this hardly
describes the realities of science funding.
Most scientiɹc studies are funded because somebody believes they can help
attain some political, economic or religious goal. For example, in the sixteenth
century, kings and bankers channelled enormous resources to ɹnance
geographical expeditions around the world but not a penny for studying child
psychology. This is because kings and bankers surmised that the discovery of new
geographical knowledge would enable them to conquer new lands and set up
trade empires, whereas they couldn’t see any proɹt in understanding child
psychology.
In the 1940s the governments of America and the Soviet Union channelled
enormous resources to the study of nuclear physics rather than underwater
archaeology. They surmised that studying nuclear physics would enable them to
develop nuclear weapons, whereas underwater archaeology was unlikely to help
win wars. Scientists themselves are not always aware of the political, economic
and religious interests that control the ɻow of money; many scientists do, in fact,
act out of pure intellectual curiosity. However, only rarely do scientists dictate the
scientific agenda.
Even if we wanted to ɹnance pure science unaʃected by political, economic or
religious interests, it would probably be impossible. Our resources are limited,
after all. Ask a congressman to allocate an additional million dollars to the
National Science Foundation for basic research, and he’ll justiɹably ask whether
that money wouldn’t be better used to fund teacher training or to give a needed
tax break to a troubled factory in his district. To channel limited resources we
must answer questions such as ‘What is more important?’ and ‘What is good?’ And
these are not scientiɹc questions. Science can explain what exists in the world,
how things work, and what might be in the future. By deɹnition, it has no
pretensions to knowing what should be in the future. Only religions and ideologies
seek to answer such questions.
Consider the following quandary: two biologists from the same department,
possessing the same professional skills, have both applied for a million-dollar
grant to ɹnance their current research projects. Professor Slughorn wants to study

a disease that infects the udders of cows, causing a 10 per cent decrease in their
milk production. Professor Sprout wants to study whether cows suʃer mentally
when they are separated from their calves. Assuming that the amount of money is
limited, and that it is impossible to ɹnance both research projects, which one
should be funded?
There is no scientiɹc answer to this question. There are only political, economic
and religious answers. In today’s world, it is obvious that Slughorn has a better
chance of getting the money. Not because udder diseases are scientiɹcally more
interesting than bovine mentality, but because the dairy industry, which stands to

beneɹt from the research, has more political and economic clout than the animal-
rights lobby.

Perhaps in a strict Hindu society, where cows are sacred, or in a society
committed to animal rights, Professor Sprout would have a better shot. But as long
as she lives in a society that values the commercial potential of milk and the
health of its human citizens over the feelings of cows, she’d best write up her
research proposal so as to appeal to those assumptions. For example, she might
write that ‘Depression leads to a decrease in milk production. If we understand the
mental world of dairy cows, we could develop psychiatric medication that will
improve their mood, thus raising milk production by up to 10 per cent. I estimate
that there is a global annual market of $250 million for bovine psychiatric
medications.’
Science is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining
what to do with its discoveries. For example, from a purely scientiɹc viewpoint it
is unclear what we should do with our increasing understanding of genetics.
Should we use this knowledge to cure cancer, to create a race of genetically
engineered supermen, or to engineer dairy cows with super-sized udders? It is
obvious that a liberal government, a Communist government, a Nazi government
and a capitalist business corporation would use the very same scientiɹc discovery
for completely diʃerent purposes, and there is no scientific reason to prefer one
usage over others.
In short, scientiɹc research can ɻourish only in alliance with some religion or
ideology. The ideology justiɹes the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology
inɻuences the scientiɹc agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries.
Hence in order to comprehend how humankind has reached Alamogordo and the
moon – rather than any number of alternative destinations – it is not enough to
survey the achievements of physicists, biologists and sociologists. We have to take
into account the ideological, political and economic forces that shaped physics,
biology and sociology, pushing them in certain directions while neglecting others.
Two forces in particular deserve our attention: imperialism and capitalism. The
feedback loop between science, empire and capital has arguably been history’s

chief engine for the past 500 years. The following chapters analyse its workings.
First we’ll look at how the twin turbines of science and empire were latched to one
another, and then learn how both were hitched up to the money pump of
capitalism.

The Marriage of Science and Empire

HOW FAR IS THE SUN FROM THE EARTH? It’s a question that intrigued many
early modern astronomers, particularly after Copernicus argued that the sun,
rather than the earth, is located at the centre of the universe. A number of
astronomers and mathematicians tried to calculate the distance, but their methods
provided widely varying results. A reliable means of making the measurement was
ɹnally proposed in the middle of the eighteenth century. Every few years, the
planet Venus passes directly between the sun and the earth. The duration of the
transit diʃers when seen from distant points on the earths surface because of the
tiny diʃerence in the angle at which the observer sees it. If several observations of
the same transit were made from different continents, simple trigonometry was all
it would take to calculate our exact distance from the sun.
Astronomers predicted that the next Venus transits would occur in 1761 and
1769. So expeditions were sent from Europe to the four corners of the world in
order to observe the transits from as many distant points as possible. In 1761
scientists observed the transit from Siberia, North America, Madagascar and South
Africa. As the 1769 transit approached, the European scientiɹc community
mounted a supreme eʃort, and scientists were dispatched as far as northern
Canada and California (which was then a wilderness). The Royal Society of
London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge concluded that this was not
enough. To obtain the most accurate results it was imperative to send an
astronomer all the way to the south-western Pacific Ocean.
The Royal Society resolved to send an eminent astronomer, Charles Green, to
Tahiti, and spared neither eʃort nor money. But, since it was funding such an
expensive expedition, it hardly made sense to use it to make just a single
astronomical observation. Green was therefore accompanied by a team of eight
other scientists from several disciplines, headed by botanists Joseph Banks and
Daniel Solander. The team also included artists assigned to produce drawings of
the new lands, plants, animals and peoples that the scientists would no doubt
encounter. Equipped with the most advanced scientiɹc instruments that Banks and
the Royal Society could buy, the expedition was placed under the command of
Captain James Cook, an experienced seaman as well as an accomplished

geographer and ethnographer.
The expedition left England in 1768, observed the Venus transit from Tahiti in
1769, reconnoitred several Paciɹc islands, visited Australia and New Zealand, and
returned to England in 1771. It brought back enormous quantities of astronomical,
geographical, meteorological, botanical, zoological and anthropological data. Its
ɹndings made major contributions to a number of disciplines, sparked the
imagination of Europeans with astonishing tales of the South Paciɹc, and inspired
future generations of naturalists and astronomers.
One of the ɹelds that beneɹted from the Cook expedition was medicine. At the
time, ships that set sail to distant shores knew that more than half their crew
members would die on the journey. The nemesis was not angry natives, enemy
warships or homesickness. It was a mysterious ailment called scurvy. Men who
came down with the disease grew lethargic and depressed, and their gums and
other soft tissues bled. As the disease progressed, their teeth fell out, open sores
appeared and they grew feverish, jaundiced, and lost control of their limbs.
Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, scurvy is estimated to have
claimed the lives of about 2 million sailors. No one knew what caused it, and no
matter what remedy was tried, sailors continued to die in droves. The turning
point came in 1747, when a British physician, James Lind, conducted a controlled
experiment on sailors who suʃered from the disease. He separated them into
several groups and gave each group a diʃerent treatment. One of the test groups
was instructed to eat citrus fruits, a common folk remedy for scurvy. The patients
in this group promptly recovered. Lind did not know what the citrus fruits had
that the sailors’ bodies lacked, but we now know that it is vitamin C. A typical
shipboard diet at that time was notably lacking in foods that are rich in this
essential nutrient. On long-range voyages sailors usually subsisted on biscuits and
beef jerky, and ate almost no fruits or vegetables.
The Royal Navy was not convinced by Lind’s experiments, but James Cook was.
He resolved to prove the doctor right. He loaded his boat with a large quantity of
sauerkraut and ordered his sailors to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables
whenever the expedition made landfall. Cook did not lose a single sailor to scurvy.
In the following decades, all the world’s navies adopted Cook’s nautical diet, and
the lives of countless sailors and passengers were saved.1
However, the Cook expedition had another, far less benign result. Cook was not
only an experienced seaman and geographer, but also a naval oɽcer. The Royal
Society ɹnanced a large part of the expedition’s expenses, but the ship itself was
provided by the Royal Navy. The navy also seconded eighty-ɹve well-armed
sailors and marines, and equipped the ship with artillery, muskets, gunpowder
and other weaponry. Much of the information collected by the expedition
particularly the astronomical, geographical, meteorological and anthropological

data – was of obvious political and military value. The discovery of an eʃective
treatment for scurvy greatly contributed to British control of the world’s oceans
and its ability to send armies to the other side of the world. Cook claimed for
Britain many of the islands and lands he ‘discovered’, most notably Australia. The

Cook expedition laid the foundation for the British occupation of the south-
western Paciɹc Ocean; for the conquest of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand;

for the settlement of millions of Europeans in the new colonies; and for the
extermination of their native cultures and most of their native populations.2
In the century following the Cook expedition, the most fertile lands of Australia
and New Zealand were taken from their previous inhabitants by European
settlers. The native population dropped by up to 90 per cent and the survivors
were subjected to a harsh regime of racial oppression. For the Aborigines of
Australia and the Maoris of New Zealand, the Cook expedition was the beginning
of a catastrophe from which they have never recovered.
An even worse fate befell the natives of Tasmania. Having survived for 10,000
years in splendid isolation, they were completely wiped out, to the last man,
woman and child, within a century of Cook’s arrival. European settlers ɹrst drove
them oʃ the richest parts of the island, and then, coveting even the remaining
wilderness, hunted them down and killed them systematically. The few survivors
were hounded into an evangelical concentration camp, where well-meaning but
not particularly open-minded missionaries tried to indoctrinate them in the ways
of the modern world. The Tasmanians were instructed in reading and writing,
Christianity and various ‘productive skills’ such as sewing clothes and farming. But
they refused to learn. They became ever more melancholic, stopped having
children, lost all interest in life, and ɹnally chose the only escape route from the
modern world of science and progress – death.
Alas, science and progress pursued them even to the afterlife. The corpses of the
last Tasmanians were seized in the name of science by anthropologists and
curators. They were dissected, weighed and measured, and analysed in learned
articles. The skulls and skeletons were then put on display in museums and
anthropological collections. Only in 1976 did the Tasmanian Museum give up for
burial the skeleton of Truganini, the last native Tasmanian, who had died a
hundred years earlier. The English Royal College of Surgeons held on to samples
of her skin and hair until 2002.
Was Cook’s ship a scientiɹc expedition protected by a military force or a
military expedition with a few scientists tagging along? That’s like asking whether
your petrol tank is half empty or half full. It was both. The Scientiɹc Revolution
and modern imperialism were inseparable. People such as Captain James Cook
and the botanist Joseph Banks could hardly distinguish science from empire. Nor
could luckless Truganini.

Why Europe?

The fact that people from a large island in the northern Atlantic conquered a large
island south of Australia is one of history’s more bizarre occurrences. Not long
before Cook’s expedition, the British Isles and western Europe in general were but
distant backwaters of the Mediterranean world. Little of importance ever
happened there. Even the Roman Empire – the only important premodern
European empire – derived most of its wealth from its North African, Balkan and
Middle Eastern provinces. Rome’s western European provinces were a poor Wild
West, which contributed little aside from minerals and slaves. Northern Europe
was so desolate and barbarous that it wasn’t even worth conquering.

35. Truganini, the last native Tasmanian.

Only at the end of the ɹfteenth century did Europe become a hothouse of
important military, political, economic and cultural developments. Between 1500
and 1750, western Europe gained momentum and became master of the ‘Outer
World’, meaning the two American continents and the oceans. Yet even then

Europe was no match for the great powers of Asia. Europeans managed to
conquer America and gain supremacy at sea mainly because the Asiatic powers
showed little interest in them. The early modern era was a golden age for the
Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean, the Safavid Empire in Persia, the Mughal
Empire in India, and the Chinese Ming and Qing dynasties. They expanded their
territories signiɹcantly and enjoyed unprecedented demographic and economic
growth. In 1775 Asia accounted for 80 per cent of the world economy. The
combined economies of India and China alone represented two-thirds of global
production. In comparison, Europe was an economic dwarf.3
The global centre of power shifted to Europe only between 1750 and 1850,
when Europeans humiliated the Asian powers in a series of wars and conquered
large parts of Asia. By 1900 Europeans ɹrmly controlled the worlds economy and
most of its territory. In 1950 western Europe and the United States together
accounted for more than half of global production, whereas Chinas portion had
been reduced to 5 per cent.4 Under the European aegis a new global order and
global culture emerged. Today all humans are, to a much greater extent than they
usually want to admit, European in dress, thought and taste. They may be ɹercely
anti-European in their rhetoric, but almost everyone on the planet views politics,
medicine, war and economics through European eyes, and listens to music written
in European modes with words in European languages. Even today’s burgeoning
Chinese economy, which may soon regain its global primacy, is built on a
European model of production and finance.
How did the people of this frigid ɹnger of Eurasia manage to break out of their
remote corner of the globe and conquer the entire world? Europe’s scientists are
often given much of the credit. It’s unquestionable that from 1850 onward
European domination rested to a large extent on the military–industrial–scientiɹc
complex and technological wizardry. All successful late modern empires cultivated
scientiɹc research in the hope of harvesting technological innovations, and many
scientists spent most of their time working on arms, medicines and machines for
their imperial masters. A common saying among European soldiers facing African
enemies was, ‘Come what may, we have machine guns, and they don’t.’ Civilian
technologies were no less important. Canned food fed soldiers, railroads and
steamships transported soldiers and their provisions, while a new arsenal of
medicines cured soldiers, sailors and locomotive engineers. These logistical
advances played a more signiɹcant role in the European conquest of Africa than
did the machine gun.
But that wasn’t the case before 1850. The military-industrial-scientiɹc complex
was still in its infancy; the technological fruits of the Scientiɹc Revolution were
unripe; and the technological gap between European, Asiatic and African powers
was small. In 1770, James Cook certainly had far better technology than the

Australian Aborigines, but so did the Chinese and the Ottomans. Why then was
Australia explored and colonised by Captain James Cook and not by Captain Wan
Zhengse or Captain Hussein Pasha? More importantly, if in 1770 Europeans had
no signiɹcant technological advantage over Muslims, Indians and Chinese, how
did they manage in the following century to open such a gap between themselves
and the rest of the world?
Why did the military-industrial-scientiɹc complex blossom in Europe rather than
India? When Britain leaped forward, why were France, Germany and the United
States quick to follow, whereas China lagged behind? When the gap between
industrial and non-industrial nations became an obvious economic and political
factor, why did Russia, Italy and Austria succeed in closing it, whereas Persia,
Egypt and the Ottoman Empire failed? After all, the technology of the ɹrst
industrial wave was relatively simple. Was it so hard for Chinese or Ottomans to
engineer steam engines, manufacture machine guns and lay down railroads?
The world’s ɹrst commercial railroad opened for business in 1830, in Britain. By
1850, Western nations were criss-crossed by almost 40,000 kilometres of railroads
– but in the whole of Asia, Africa and Latin America there were only 4,000
kilometres of tracks. In 1880, the West boasted more than 350,000 kilometres of
railroads, whereas in the rest of the world there were but 35,000 kilometres of
train lines (and most of these were laid by the British in India).5 The ɹrst railroad
in China opened only in 1876. It was twenty-ɹve kilometres long and built by
Europeans – the Chinese government destroyed it the following year. In 1880 the
Chinese Empire did not operate a single railroad. The ɹrst railroad in Persia was
built only in 1888, and it connected Tehran with a Muslim holy site about ten
kilometres south of the capital. It was constructed and operated by a Belgian
company. In 1950, the total railway network of Persia still amounted to a meagre
2,500 kilometres, in a country seven times the size of Britain.6
The Chinese and Persians did not lack technological inventions such as steam
engines (which could be freely copied or bought). They lacked the values, myths,
judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures that took centuries to form and
mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly.
France and the United States quickly followed in Britain’s footsteps because the
French and Americans already shared the most important British myths and social
structures. The Chinese and Persians could not catch up as quickly because they
thought and organised their societies differently.
This explanation sheds new light on the period from 1500 to 1850. During this
era Europe did not enjoy any obvious technological, political, military or
economic advantage over the Asian powers, yet the continent built up a unique
potential, whose importance suddenly became obvious around 1850. The apparent
equality between Europe, China and the Muslim world in 1750 was a mirage.

Imagine two builders, each busy constructing very tall towers. One builder uses
wood and mud bricks, whereas the other uses steel and concrete. At ɹrst it seems
that there is not much of a diʃerence between the two methods, since both towers
grow at a similar pace and reach a similar height. However, once a critical
threshold is crossed, the wood and mud tower cannot stand the strain and
collapses, whereas the steel and concrete tower grows storey by storey, as far as
the eye can see.
What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to
dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this
question: modern science and capitalism. Europeans were used to thinking and
behaving in a scientiɹc and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any
signiɹcant technological advantages. When the technological bonanza began,
Europeans could harness it far better than anybody else. So it is hardly
coincidental that science and capitalism form the most important legacy that
European imperialism has bequeathed the post-European world of the twenty-ɹrst
century. Europe and Europeans no longer rule the world, but science and capital
are growing ever stronger. The victories of capitalism are examined in the
following chapter. This chapter is dedicated to the love story between European
imperialism and modern science.

The Mentality of Conquest

Modern science ɻourished in and thanks to European empires. The discipline
obviously owes a huge debt to ancient scientiɹc traditions, such as those of
classical Greece, China, India and Islam, yet its unique character began to take
shape only in the early modern period, hand in hand with the imperial expansion
of Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, Russia and the Netherlands. During the early
modern period, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, Native Americans and Polynesians
continued to make important contributions to the Scientiɹc Revolution. The
insights of Muslim economists were studied by Adam Smith and Karl Marx,
treatments pioneered by Native American doctors found their way into English
medical texts and data extracted from Polynesian informants revolutionised
Western anthropology. But until the mid-twentieth century, the people who
collated these myriad scientiɹc discoveries, creating scientiɹc disciplines in the
process, were the ruling and intellectual elites of the global European empires.
The Far East and the Islamic world produced minds as intelligent and curious as
those of Europe. However, between 1500 and 1950 they did not produce anything
that comes even close to Newtonian physics or Darwinian biology.

This does not mean that Europeans have a unique gene for science, or that they
will forever dominate the study of physics and biology. Just as Islam began as an
Arab monopoly but was subsequently taken over by Turks and Persians, so

modern science began as a European speciality, but is today becoming a multi-
ethnic enterprise.

What forged the historical bond between modern science and European
imperialism? Technology was an important factor in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, but in the early modern era it was of limited importance. The key factor
was that the plant-seeking botanist and the colony-seeking naval oɽcer shared a
similar mindset. Both scientist and conqueror began by admitting ignorance – they
both said, ‘I don’t know what’s out there.’ They both felt compelled to go out and
make new discoveries. And they both hoped the new knowledge thus acquired
would make them masters of the world.

European imperialism was entirely unlike all other imperial projects in history.
Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the
world. Conquest merely utilised and spread their view of the world. The Arabs, to
name one example, did not conquer Egypt, Spain or India in order to discover
something they did not know. The Romans, Mongols and Aztecs voraciously
conquered new lands in search of power and wealth – not of knowledge. In
contrast, European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining
new knowledge along with new territories.
James Cook was not the ɹrst explorer to think this way. The Portuguese and
Spanish voyagers of the ɹfteenth and sixteenth centuries already did. Prince
Henry the Navigator and Vasco da Gama explored the coasts of Africa and, while
doing so, seized control of islands and harbours. Christopher Columbus
‘discovered’ America and immediately claimed sovereignty over the new lands for
the kings of Spain. Ferdinand Magellan found a way around the world, and
simultaneously laid the foundation for the Spanish conquest of the Philippines.
As time went by, the conquest of knowledge and the conquest of territory
became ever more tightly intertwined. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
almost every important military expedition that left Europe for distant lands had
on board scientists who set out not to ɹght but to make scientiɹc discoveries.
When Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, he took 165 scholars with him. Among
other things, they founded an entirely new discipline, Egyptology, and made
important contributions to the study of religion, linguistics and botany.
In 1831, the Royal Navy sent the ship HMS Beagle to map the coasts of South
America, the Falklands Islands and the Galapagos Islands. The navy needed this
knowledge in order to be better prepared in the event of war. The ship’s captain,
who was an amateur scientist, decided to add a geologist to the expedition to

study geological formations they might encounter on the way. After several
professional geologists refused his invitation, the captain oʃered the job to a
twenty-two-year-old Cambridge graduate, Charles Darwin. Darwin had studied to
become an Anglican parson but was far more interested in geology and natural
sciences than in the Bible. He jumped at the opportunity, and the rest is history.
The captain spent his time on the voyage drawing military maps while Darwin
collected the empirical data and formulated the insights that would eventually
become the theory of evolution.

On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the surface of the
moon. In the months leading up to their expedition, the Apollo 11 astronauts
trained in a remote moon-like desert in the western United States. The area is
home to several Native American communities, and there is a story – or legend –
describing an encounter between the astronauts and one of the locals.
One day as they were training, the astronauts came across an old Native
American. The man asked them what they were doing there. They replied that
they were part of a research expedition that would shortly travel to explore the
moon. When the old man heard that, he fell silent for a few moments, and then
asked the astronauts if they could do him a favour.
‘What do you want?’ they asked.
‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on
the moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from
my people.’
‘What’s the message?’ asked the astronauts.
The man uttered something in his tribal language, and then asked the
astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorised it correctly.
‘What does it mean?’ asked the astronauts.
‘Oh, I cannot tell you. It’s a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are
allowed to know.’
When they returned to their base, the astronauts searched and searched until
they found someone who could speak the tribal language, and asked him to
translate the secret message. When they repeated what they had memorised, the
translator started to laugh uproariously. When he calmed down, the astronauts
asked him what it meant. The man explained that the sentence they had
memorised so carefully said, ‘Don’t believe a single word these people are telling
you. They have come to steal your lands.’

Empty Maps

The modern ‘explore and conquer’ mentality is nicely illustrated by the
development of world maps. Many cultures drew world maps long before the
modern age. Obviously, none of them really knew the whole of the world. No
Afro-Asian culture knew about America, and no American culture knew about
Afro-Asia. But unfamiliar areas were simply left out, or ɹlled with imaginary
monsters and wonders. These maps had no empty spaces. They gave the
impression of a familiarity with the entire world.
During the ɹfteenth and sixteenth centuries, Europeans began to draw world
maps with lots of empty spaces – one indication of the development of the
scientiɹc mindset, as well as of the European imperial drive. The empty maps
were a psychological and ideological breakthrough, a clear admission that
Europeans were ignorant of large parts of the world.
The crucial turning point came in 1492, when Christopher Columbus sailed
westward from Spain, seeking a new route to East Asia. Columbus still believed in
the old ‘complete’ world maps. Using them, Columbus calculated that Japan
should have been located about 7,000 kilometres west of Spain. In fact, more than
20,000 kilometres and an entire unknown continent separate East Asia from
Spain. On 12 October 1492, at about 2:00 a.m., Columbus’ expedition collided
with the unknown continent. Juan Rodriguez Bermejo, watching from the mast of
the ship Pinta, spotted an island in what we now call the Bahamas, and shouted
‘Land! Land!’
Columbus believed he had reached a small island oʃ the East Asian coast. He
called the people he found there ‘Indians’ because he thought he had landed in the
Indies – what we now call the East Indies or the Indonesian archipelago.
Columbus stuck to this error for the rest of his life. The idea that he had discovered
a completely unknown continent was inconceivable for him and for many of his
generation. For thousands of years, not only the greatest thinkers and scholars but
also the infallible Scriptures had known only Europe, Africa and Asia. Could they
all have been wrong? Could the Bible have missed half the world? It would be as if
in 1969, on its way to the moon, Apollo 11 had crashed into a hitherto unknown
moon circling the earth, which all previous observations had somehow failed to
spot. In his refusal to admit ignorance, Columbus was still a medieval man. He
was convinced he knew the whole world, and even his momentous discovery
failed to convince him otherwise.

36. A European world map from 1459 (Europe is in the top left corner). The map is filled with details,
even when depicting areas that were completely unfamiliar to Europeans, such as southern Africa.

The ɹrst modern man was Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian sailor who took part in
several expeditions to America in the years 1499–1504. Between 1502 and 1504,
two texts describing these expeditions were published in Europe. They were
attributed to Vespucci. These texts argued that the new lands discovered by
Columbus were not islands oʃ the East Asian coast, but rather an entire continent
unknown to the Scriptures, classical geographers and contemporary Europeans. In
1507, convinced by these arguments, a respected mapmaker named Martin
Waldseemüller published an updated world map, the ɹrst to show the place where
Europe’s westward-sailing ɻeets had landed as a separate continent. Having
drawn it, Waldseemüller had to give it a name. Erroneously believing that
Amerigo Vespucci had been the person who discovered it, Waldseemüller named
the continent in his honour – America. The Waldseemüller map became very
popular and was copied by many other cartographers, spreading the name he had
given the new land. There is poetic justice in the fact that a quarter of the world,
and two of its seven continents, are named after a little-known Italian whose sole

claim to fame is that he had the courage to say, ‘We don’t know.’
The discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientiɹc
Revolution. It not only taught Europeans to favour present observations over past
traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged Europeans to search for
new knowledge at breakneck speed. If they really wanted to control the vast new
territories, they had to gather enormous amounts of new data about the
geography, climate, ɻora, fauna, languages, cultures and history of the new
continent. Christian Scriptures, old geography books and ancient oral traditions
were of little help.
Henceforth not only European geographers, but European scholars in almost all
other ɹelds of knowledge began to draw maps with spaces left to ɹll in. They
began to admit that their theories were not perfect and that there were important
things that they did not know.

The Europeans were drawn to the blank spots on the map as if they were
magnets, and promptly started ɹlling them in. During the ɹfteenth and sixteenth
centuries, European expeditions circumnavigated Africa, explored America,
crossed the Paciɹc and Indian Oceans, and created a network of bases and
colonies all over the world. They established the ɹrst truly global empires and
knitted together the ɹrst global trade network. The European imperial expeditions
transformed the history of the world: from being a series of histories of isolated
peoples and cultures, it became the history of a single integrated human society.

37. The Salviati World Map, 1525. While the 1459 world map is full of continents, islands and detailed
explanations, the Salviati map is mostly empty. The eye wanders south along the American coastline,
until it peters into emptiness. Anyone looking at the map and possessing even minimal curiosity is
tempted to ask, ‘What’s beyond this point?’ The map gives no answers. It invites the observer to set sail

and find out.

These European explore-and-conquer expeditions are so familiar to us that we
tend to overlook just how extraordinary they were. Nothing like them had ever
happened before. Long-distance campaigns of conquest are not a natural
undertaking. Throughout history most human societies were so busy with local
conɻicts and neighbourhood quarrels that they never considered exploring and
conquering distant lands. Most great empires extended their control only over
their immediate neighbourhood – they reached far-ɻung lands simply because
their neighbourhood kept expanding. Thus the Romans conquered Etruria in order
to defend Rome (c.350–300 BC). They then conquered the Po Valley in order to
defend Etruria (c.200 BC). They subsequently conquered Provence to defend the Po
Valley (c.120 BC), Gaul to defend Provence (c.50 BC), and Britain in order to defend
Gaul (c. AD 50). It took them 400 years to get from Rome to London. In 350 BC, no
Roman would have conceived of sailing directly to Britain and conquering it.
Occasionally an ambitious ruler or adventurer would embark on a long-range
campaign of conquest, but such campaigns usually followed well-beaten imperial
or commercial paths. The campaigns of Alexander the Great, for example, did not
result in the establishment of a new empire, but rather in the usurpation of an
existing empire – that of the Persians. The closest precedents to the modern
European empires were the ancient naval empires of Athens and Carthage, and
the medieval naval empire of Majapahit, which held sway over much of Indonesia
in the fourteenth century. Yet even these empires rarely ventured into unknown
seas – their naval exploits were local undertakings when compared to the global
ventures of the modern Europeans.
Many scholars argue that the voyages of Admiral Zheng He of the Chinese Ming
dynasty heralded and eclipsed the European voyages of discovery. Between 1405
and 1433, Zheng led seven huge armadas from China to the far reaches of the
Indian Ocean. The largest of these comprised almost 300 ships and carried close to
30,000 people.7 They visited Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, the Persian Gulf, the Red
Sea and East Africa. Chinese ships anchored in Jedda, the main harbour of the
Hejaz, and in Malindi, on the Kenyan coast. Columbus’ ɻeet of 1492 – which
consisted of three small ships manned by 120 sailors – was like a trio of
mosquitoes compared to Zheng He’s drove of dragons.8
Yet there was a crucial diʃerence. Zheng He explored the oceans, and assisted
pro-Chinese rulers, but he did not try to conquer or colonise the countries he
visited. Moreover, the expeditions of Zheng He were not deeply rooted in Chinese
politics and culture. When the ruling faction in Beijing changed during the 1430s,
the new overlords abruptly terminated the operation. The great ɻeet was
dismantled, crucial technical and geographical knowledge was lost, and no
explorer of such stature and means ever set out again from a Chinese port.

Chinese rulers in the coming centuries, like most Chinese rulers in previous
centuries, restricted their interests and ambitions to the Middle Kingdom’s
immediate environs.
The Zheng He expeditions prove that Europe did not enjoy an outstanding
technological edge. What made Europeans exceptional was their unparalleled and
insatiable ambition to explore and conquer. Although they might have had the
ability, the Romans never attempted to conquer India or Scandinavia, the Persians
never attempted to conquer Madagascar or Spain, and the Chinese never
attempted to conquer Indonesia or Africa. Most Chinese rulers left even nearby
Japan to its own devices. There was nothing peculiar about that. The oddity is
that early modern Europeans caught a fever that drove them to sail to distant and
completely unknown lands full of alien cultures, take one step on to their beaches,
and immediately declare, ‘I claim all these territories for my king!’

Invasion from Outer Space

Around 1517, Spanish colonists in the Caribbean islands began to hear vague
rumours about a powerful empire somewhere in the centre of the Mexican
mainland. A mere four years later, the Aztec capital was a smouldering ruin, the
Aztec Empire was a thing of the past, and Hernán Cortés lorded over a vast new

Spanish Empire in Mexico.
The Spaniards did not stop to congratulate themselves or even to catch their
breath. They immediately commenced explore-and-conquer operations in all
directions. The previous rulers of Central America – the Aztecs, the Toltecs, the
Maya – barely knew South America existed, and never made any attempt to
subjugate it, over the course of 2,000 years. Yet within little more than ten years
of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, Francisco Pizarro had discovered the Inca
Empire in South America, vanquishing it in 1532.
Had the Aztecs and Incas shown a bit more interest in the world surrounding
them – and had they known what the Spaniards had done to their neighbours –
they might have resisted the Spanish conquest more keenly and successfully. In the
years separating Columbus’ ɹrst journey to America (1492) from the landing of
Cortés in Mexico (1519), the Spaniards conquered most of the Caribbean islands,
setting up a chain of new colonies. For the subjugated natives, these colonies were
hell on earth. They were ruled with an iron ɹst by greedy and unscrupulous
colonists who enslaved them and set them to work in mines and plantations,
killing anyone who oʃered the slightest resistance. Most of the native population
soon died, either because of the harsh working conditions or the virulence of the
diseases that hitch-hiked to America on the conquerors’ sailing ships. Within
twenty years, almost the entire native Caribbean population was wiped out. The
Spanish colonists began importing African slaves to fill the vacuum.
This genocide took place on the very doorstep of the Aztec Empire, yet when
Cortés landed on the empire’s eastern coast, the Aztecs knew nothing about it. The
coming of the Spaniards was the equivalent of an alien invasion from outer space.
The Aztecs were convinced that they knew the entire world and that they ruled
most of it. To them it was unimaginable that outside their domain could exist
anything like these Spaniards. When Cortés and his men landed on the sunny
beaches of today’s Vera Cruz, it was the ɹrst time the Aztecs encountered a
completely unknown people.
The Aztecs did not know how to react. They had trouble deciding what these
strangers were. Unlike all known humans, the aliens had white skins. They also
had lots of facial hair. Some had hair the colour of the sun. They stank horribly.
(Native hygiene was far better than Spanish hygiene. When the Spaniards ɹrst
arrived in Mexico, natives bearing incense burners were assigned to accompany
them wherever they went. The Spaniards thought it was a mark of divine honour.
We know from native sources that they found the newcomers’ smell unbearable.)

Map 7. The Aztec and Inca empires at the time of the Spanish conquest.

The aliens’ material culture was even more bewildering. They came in giant
ships, the like of which the Aztecs had never imagined, let alone seen. They rode
on the back of huge and terrifying animals, swift as the wind. They could produce
lightning and thunder out of shiny metal sticks. They had ɻashing long swords
and impenetrable armour, against which the natives’ wooden swords and ɻint
spears were useless.
Some Aztecs thought these must be gods. Others argued that they were demons,
or the ghosts of the dead, or powerful sorcerers. Instead of concentrating all
available forces and wiping out the Spaniards, the Aztecs deliberated, dawdled
and negotiated. They saw no reason to rush. After all, Cortés had no more than
550 Spaniards with him. What could 550 men do to an empire of millions?
Cortés was equally ignorant about the Aztecs, but he and his men held
signiɹcant advantages over their adversaries. While the Aztecs had no experience
to prepare them for the arrival of these strange-looking and foul-smelling aliens,
the Spaniards knew that the earth was full of unknown human realms, and no one
had greater expertise in invading alien lands and dealing with situations about
which they were utterly ignorant. For the modern European conqueror, like the
modern European scientist, plunging into the unknown was exhilarating.
So when Cortés anchored oʃ that sunny beach in July 1519, he did not hesitate

to act. Like a science-ɹction alien emerging from his spaceship, he declared to the
awestruck locals: ‘We come in peace. Take us to your leader.’ Cortés explained
that he was a peaceful emissary from the great king of Spain, and asked for a
diplomatic interview with the Aztec ruler, Montezuma II. (This was a shameless
lie. Cortés led an independent expedition of greedy adventurers. The king of Spain
had never heard of Cortés, nor of the Aztecs.) Cortés was given guides, food and
some military assistance by local enemies of the Aztecs. He then marched towards
the Aztec capital, the great metropolis of Tenochtitlan.
The Aztecs allowed the aliens to march all the way to the capital, then
respectfully led the aliens’ leader to meet Emperor Montezuma. In the middle of
the interview, Cortés gave a signal, and steel-armed Spaniards butchered
Montezuma’s bodyguards (who were armed only with wooden clubs, and stone
blades). The honoured guest took his host prisoner.
Cortés was now in a very delicate situation. He had captured the emperor, but
was surrounded by tens of thousands of furious enemy warriors, millions of hostile
civilians, and an entire continent about which he knew practically nothing. He
had at his disposal only a few hundred Spaniards, and the closest Spanish
reinforcements were in Cuba, more than 1,500 kilometres away.
Cortés kept Montezuma captive in the palace, making it look as if the king
remained free and in charge and as if the ‘Spanish ambassador’ were no more
than a guest. The Aztec Empire was an extremely centralised polity, and this
unprecedented situation paralysed it. Montezuma continued to behave as if he
ruled the empire, and the Aztec elite continued to obey him, which meant they
obeyed Cortés. This situation lasted for several months, during which time Cortés
interrogated Montezuma and his attendants, trained translators in a variety of
local languages, and sent small Spanish expeditions in all directions to become
familiar with the Aztec Empire and the various tribes, peoples and cities that it
ruled.
The Aztec elite eventually revolted against Cortés and Montezuma, elected a
new emperor, and drove the Spaniards from Tenochtitlan. However, by now
numerous cracks had appeared in the imperial ediɹce. Cortés used the knowledge
he had gained to prise the cracks open wider and split the empire from within. He
convinced many of the empire’s subject peoples to join him against the ruling
Aztec elite. The subject peoples miscalculated badly. They hated the Aztecs, but
knew nothing of Spain or the Caribbean genocide. They assumed that with
Spanish help they could shake oʃ the Aztec yoke. The idea that the Spanish would
take over never occurred to them. They were sure that if Cortés and his few
hundred henchmen caused any trouble, they could easily be overwhelmed. The
rebellious peoples provided Cortés with an army of tens of thousands of local
troops, and with its help Cortés besieged Tenochtitlan and conquered the city.

At this stage more and more Spanish soldiers and settlers began arriving in
Mexico, some from Cuba, others all the way from Spain. When the local peoples
realised what was happening, it was too late. Within a century of the landing at
Vera Cruz, the native population of the Americas had shrunk by about 90 per cent,
due mainly to unfamiliar diseases that reached America with the invaders. The
survivors found themselves under the thumb of a greedy and racist regime that
was far worse than that of the Aztecs.
Ten years after Cortés landed in Mexico, Pizarro arrived on the shore of the Inca
Empire. He had far fewer soldiers than Cortés – his expedition numbered just 168
men! Yet Pizarro beneɹted from all the knowledge and experience gained in
previous invasions. The Inca, in contrast, knew nothing about the fate of the
Aztecs. Pizarro plagiarised Cortés. He declared himself a peaceful emissary from
the king of Spain, invited the Inca ruler, Atahualpa, to a diplomatic interview,
and then kidnapped him. Pizarro proceeded to conquer the paralysed empire with
the help of local allies. If the subject peoples of the Inca Empire had known the
fate of the inhabitants of Mexico, they would not have thrown in their lot with the
invaders. But they did not know.

The native peoples of America were not the only ones to pay a heavy price for
their parochial outlook. The great empires of Asia – the Ottoman, the Safavid, the
Mughal and the Chinese – very quickly heard that the Europeans had discovered
something big. Yet they displayed little interest in these discoveries. They
continued to believe that the world revolved around Asia, and made no attempt to
compete with the Europeans for control of America or of the new ocean lanes in
the Atlantic and the Paciɹc. Even puny European kingdoms such as Scotland and
Denmark sent a few explore-and-conquer expeditions to America, but not one
expedition of either exploration or conquest was ever sent to America from the
Islamic world, India or China. The ɹrst non-European power that tried to send a
military expedition to America was Japan. That happened in June 1942, when a
Japanese expedition conquered Kiska and Attu, two small islands oʃ the Alaskan
coast, capturing in the process ten US soldiers and a dog. The Japanese never got
any closer to the mainland.
It is hard to argue that the Ottomans or Chinese were too far away, or that they
lacked the technological, economic or military wherewithal. The resources that
sent Zheng He from China to East Africa in the 1420S should have been enough to
reach America. The Chinese just weren’t interested. The ɹrst Chinese world map to
show America was not issued until 1602 – and then by a European missionary!
For 300 years, Europeans enjoyed undisputed mastery in America and Oceania,
in the Atlantic and the Paciɹc. The only signiɹcant struggles in those regions were
between diʃerent European powers. The wealth and resources accumulated by the

Europeans eventually enabled them to invade Asia too, defeat its empires, and
divide it among themselves. When the Ottomans, Persians, Indians and Chinese
woke up and began paying attention, it was too late.

Only in the twentieth century did non-European cultures adopt a truly global
vision. This was one of the crucial factors that led to the collapse of European
hegemony. Thus in the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), Algerian
guerrillas defeated a French army with an overwhelming numerical, technological
and economic advantage. The Algerians prevailed because they were supported by
a global anti-colonial network, and because they worked out how to harness the
world’s media to their cause – as well as public opinion in France itself. The defeat
that little North Vietnam inɻicted on the American colossus was based on a similar
strategy. These guerrilla forces showed that even superpowers could be defeated if
a local struggle became a global cause. It is interesting to contemplate what might
have happened had Montezuma been able to manipulate public opinion in Spain
and gain assistance from one of Spain’s rivals – Portugal, France or the Ottoman
Empire.

Rare Spiders and Forgotten Scripts

Modern science and modern empires were motivated by the restless feeling that
perhaps something important awaited beyond the horizon – something they had
better explore and master. Yet the connection between science and empire went
much deeper. Not just the motivation, but also the practices of empire-builders
were entangled with those of scientists. For modern Europeans, building an
empire was a scientiɹc project, while setting up a scientiɹc discipline was an
imperial project.
When the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring along archaeologists to
systematically study Indian history, anthropologists to study Indian cultures,
geologists to study Indian soils, or zoologists to study Indian fauna. When the
British conquered India, they did all of these things. On 10 April 1802 the Great
Survey of India was launched. It lasted sixty years. With the help of tens of
thousands of native labourers, scholars and guides, the British carefully mapped
the whole of India, marking borders, measuring distances, and even calculating
for the ɹrst time the exact height of Mount Everest and the other Himalayan
peaks. The British explored the military resources of Indian provinces and the
location of their gold mines, but they also took the trouble to collect information
about rare Indian spiders, to catalogue colourful butterɻies, to trace the ancient

origins of extinct Indian languages, and to dig up forgotten ruins.
Mohenjo-daro was one of the chief cities of the Indus Valley civilisation, which
ɻourished in the third millennium BC and was destroyed around 1900 BC. None of
India’s pre-British rulers – neither the Mauryas, nor the Guptas, nor the Delhi
sultans, nor the great Mughals – had given the ruins a second glance. But a British
archaeological survey took notice of the site in 1922. A British team then
excavated it, and discovered the ɹrst great civilisation of India, which no Indian
had been aware of.
Another telling example of British scientiɹc curiosity was the deciphering of
cuneiform script. This was the main script used throughout the Middle East for
close to 3,000 years, but the last person able to read it probably died sometime in
the early ɹrst millennium AD. Since then, inhabitants of the region frequently
encountered cuneiform inscriptions on monuments, steles, ancient ruins and
broken pots. But they had no idea how to read the weird, angular scratches and,
as far as we know, they never tried. Cuneiform came to the attention of
Europeans in 1618, when the Spanish ambassador in Persia went sightseeing in
the ruins of ancient Persepolis, where he saw inscriptions that nobody could
explain to him. News of the unknown script spread among European savants and
piqued their curiosity. In 1657 European scholars published the ɹrst transcription
of a cuneiform text from Persepolis. More and more transcriptions followed, and
for close to two centuries scholars in the West tried to decipher them. None
succeeded.
In the 1830s, a British oɽcer named Henry Rawlinson was sent to Persia to
help the shah train his army in the European style. In his spare time Rawlinson
travelled around Persia and one day he was led by local guides to a cliʃ in the
Zagros Mountains and shown the huge Behistun Inscription. About ɹfteen metres
high and twenty-ɹve metres wide, it had been etched high up on the cliʃ face on
the command of King Darius I sometime around 500 BC. It was written in
cuneiform script in three languages: Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian. The
inscription was well known to the local population, but nobody could read it.
Rawlinson became convinced that if he could decipher the writing it would enable
him and other scholars to read the numerous inscriptions and texts that were at
the time being discovered all over the Middle East, opening a door into an ancient
and forgotten world.
The ɹrst step in deciphering the lettering was to produce an accurate
transcription that could be sent back to Europe. Rawlinson deɹed death to do so,
scaling the steep cliʃ to copy the strange letters. He hired several locals to help
him, most notably a Kurdish boy who climbed to the most inaccessible parts of the
cliʃ in order to copy the upper portion of the inscription. In 1847 the project was
completed, and a full and accurate copy was sent to Europe.

Rawlinson did not rest on his laurels. As an army oɽcer, he had military and
political missions to carry out, but whenever he had a spare moment he puzzled
over the secret script. He tried one method after another and ɹnally managed to
decipher the Old Persian part of the inscription. This was easiest, since Old
Persian was not that diʃerent from modern Persian, which Rawlinson knew well.
An understanding of the Old Persian section gave him the key he needed to unlock
the secrets of the Elamite and Babylonian sections. The great door swung open,
and out came a rush of ancient but lively voices – the bustle of Sumerian bazaars,
the proclamations of Assyrian kings, the arguments of Babylonian bureaucrats.
Without the eʃorts of modern European imperialists such as Rawlinson, we would
not have known much about the fate of the ancient Middle Eastern empires.

Another notable imperialist scholar was William Jones. Jones arrived in India in
September 1783 to serve as a judge in the Supreme Court of Bengal. He was so
captivated by the wonders of India that within less than six months of his arrival
he had founded the Asiatic Society. This academic organisation was devoted to
studying the cultures, histories and societies of Asia, and in particular those of
India. Within two years Jones published his observations on the Sanskrit
language, which pioneered the science of comparative linguistics.
In his publications Jones pointed out surprising similarities between Sanskrit,
an ancient Indian language that became the sacred tongue of Hindu ritual, and
the Greek and Latin languages, as well as similarities between all these languages
and Gothic, Celtic, Old Persian, German, French and English. Thus in Sanskrit,
‘mother’ is ‘matar’, in Latin it is ‘mater’, and in Old Celtic it is ‘mathir’. Jones
surmised that all these languages must share a common origin, developing from a
now-forgotten ancient ancestor. He was thus the ɹrst to identify what later came
to be called the Indo-European family of languages.
Jones’ study was an important milestone not merely due to his bold (and
accurate) hypotheses, but also because of the orderly methodology that he
developed to compare languages. It was adopted by other scholars, enabling them
systematically to study the development of all the world’s languages.
Linguistics received enthusiastic imperial support. The European empires
believed that in order to govern eʃectively they must know the languages and
cultures of their subjects. British oɽcers arriving in India were supposed to spend
up to three years in a Calcutta college, where they studied Hindu and Muslim law
alongside English law; Sanskrit, Urdu and Persian alongside Greek and Latin; and
Tamil, Bengali and Hindustani culture alongside mathematics, economics and
geography. The study of linguistics provided invaluable help in understanding the
structure and grammar of local languages.
Thanks to the work of people like William Jones and Henry Rawlinson, the

European conquerors knew their empires very well. Far better, indeed, than any
previous conquerors, or even than the native population itself. Their superior
knowledge had obvious practical advantages. Without such knowledge, it is
unlikely that a ridiculously small number of Britons could have succeeded in
governing, oppressing and exploiting so many hundreds of millions of Indians for
two centuries. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fewer
than 5,000 British oɽcials, about 40,000–70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps
another 100,000 British business people, hangers-on, wives and children were
sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians.9
Yet these practical advantages were not the only reason why empires ɹnanced
the study of linguistics, botany, geography and history. No less important was the
fact that science gave the empires ideological justiɹcation. Modern Europeans
came to believe that acquiring new knowledge was always good. The fact that the
empires produced a constant stream of new knowledge branded them as
progressive and positive enterprises. Even today, histories of sciences such as
geography, archaeology and botany cannot avoid crediting the European empires,
at least indirectly. Histories of botany have little to say about the suʃering of the
Aboriginal Australians, but they usually ɹnd some kind words for James Cook and
Joseph Banks.
Furthermore, the new knowledge accumulated by the empires made it possible,
at least in theory, to beneɹt the conquered populations and bring them the
beneɹts of ‘progress’ – to provide them with medicine and education, to build
railroads and canals, to ensure justice and prosperity. Imperialists claimed that
their empires were not vast enterprises of exploitation but rather altruistic
projects conducted for the sake of the non-European races – in Rudyard Kipling’s
words, ‘the White Man’s burden’:
Take up the White Man’s burden –
Send forth the best ye breed –
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives’ need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild –
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.

Of course, the facts often belied this myth. The British conquered Bengal, the
richest province of India, in 1764. The new rulers were interested in little except
enriching themselves. They adopted a disastrous economic policy that a few years
later led to the outbreak of the Great Bengal Famine. It began in 1769, reached

catastrophic levels in 1770, and lasted until 1773. About 10 million Bengalis, a
third of the province’s population, died in the calamity.10
In truth, neither the narrative of oppression and exploitation nor that of ‘The
White Man’s Burden’ completely matches the facts. The European empires did so
many diʃerent things on such a large scale, that you can ɹnd plenty of examples
to support whatever you want to say about them. You think that these empires
were evil monstrosities that spread death, oppression and injustice around the
world? You could easily ɹll an encyclopedia with their crimes. You want to argue
that they in fact improved the conditions of their subjects with new medicines,
better economic conditions and greater security? You could ɹll another
encyclopedia with their achievements. Due to their close cooperation with science,
these empires wielded so much power and changed the world to such an extent
that perhaps they cannot be simply labelled as good or evil. They created the
world as we know it, including the ideologies we use in order to judge them.
But science was also used by imperialists to more sinister ends. Biologists,
anthropologists and even linguists provided scientiɹc proof that Europeans are
superior to all other races, and consequently have the right (if not perhaps the
duty) to rule over them. After William Jones argued that all Indo-European
languages descend from a single ancient language many scholars were eager to
discover who the speakers of that language had been. They noticed that the
earliest Sanskrit speakers, who had invaded India from Central Asia more than
3,000 years ago, had called themselves Arya. The speakers of the earliest Persian
language called themselves Airiia. European scholars consequently surmised that
the people who spoke the primordial language that gave birth to both Sanskrit
and Persian (as well as to Greek, Latin, Gothic and Celtic) must have called
themselves Aryans. Could it be a coincidence that those who founded the
magnificent Indian, Persian, Greek and Roman civilisations were all Aryans?
Next, British, French and German scholars wedded the linguistic theory about
the industrious Aryans to Darwin’s theory of natural selection and posited that the
Aryans were not just a linguistic group but a biological entity – a race. And not
just any race, but a master race of tall, light-haired, blue-eyed, hard-working, and
super-rational humans who emerged from the mists of the north to lay the
foundations of culture throughout the world. Regrettably, the Aryans who invaded
India and Persia intermarried with the local natives they found in these lands,
losing their light complexions and blond hair, and with them their rationality and
diligence. The civilisations of India and Persia consequently declined. In Europe,
on the other hand, the Aryans preserved their racial purity. This is why Europeans
had managed to conquer the world, and why they were ɹt to rule it – provided
they took precautions not to mix with inferior races.
Such racist theories, prominent and respectable for many decades, have become

anathema among scientists and politicians alike. People continue to conduct a
heroic struggle against racism without noticing that the battlefront has shifted,
and that the place of racism in imperial ideology has now been replaced by
‘culturism’. There is no such word, but it’s about time we coined it. Among today’s
elites, assertions about the contrasting merits of diverse human groups are almost
always couched in terms of historical diʃerences between cultures rather than
biological diʃerences between races. We no longer say, ‘It’s in their blood.’ We
say, ‘It’s in their culture.’
Thus European right-wing parties which oppose Muslim immigration usually
take care to avoid racial terminology. Marine le Pen’s speechwriters would have
been shown the door on the spot had they suggested that the leader of the Front
National go on television to declare that, ‘We don’t want those inferior Semites to
dilute our Aryan blood and spoil our Aryan civilisation.’ Instead, the French Front
National, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alliance for the Future of Austria and
their like tend to argue that Western culture, as it has evolved in Europe, is
characterised by democratic values, tolerance and gender equality, whereas
Muslim culture, which evolved in the Middle East, is characterised by hierarchical
politics, fanaticism and misogyny. Since the two cultures are so diʃerent, and
since many Muslim immigrants are unwilling (and perhaps unable) to adopt
Western values, they should not be allowed to enter, lest they foment internal
conflicts and corrode European democracy and liberalism.
Such culturist arguments are fed by scientiɹc studies in the humanities and
social sciences that highlight the so-called clash of civilisations and the
fundamental diʃerences between diʃerent cultures. Not all historians and
anthropologists accept these theories or support their political usages. But whereas
biologists today have an easy time disavowing racism, simply explaining that the
biological diʃerences between present-day human populations are trivial, it is
harder for historians and anthropologists to disavow culturism. After all, if the
diʃerences between human cultures are trivial, why should we pay historians and
anthropologists to study them?

Scientists have provided the imperial project with practical knowledge, ideological
justiɹcation and technological gadgets. Without this contribution it is highly
questionable whether Europeans could have conquered the world. The conquerors
returned the favour by providing scientists with information and protection,
supporting all kinds of strange and fascinating projects and spreading the
scientiɹc way of thinking to the far corners of the earth. Without imperial
support, it is doubtful whether modern science would have progressed very far.
There are very few scientiɹc disciplines that did not begin their lives as servants
to imperial growth and that do not owe a large proportion of their discoveries,

collections, buildings and scholarships to the generous help of army oɽcers, navy
captains and imperial governors.
This is obviously not the whole story. Science was supported by other
institutions, not just by empires. And the European empires rose and ɻourished
thanks also to factors other than science. Behind the meteoric rise of both science
and empire lurks one particularly important force: capitalism. Were it not for
businessmen seeking to make money, Columbus would not have reached America,
James Cook would not have reached Australia, and Neil Armstrong would never
have taken that small step on the surface of the moon.

The Capitalist Creed

MONEY HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL BOTH FOR building empires and for promoting
science. But is money the ultimate goal of these undertakings, or perhaps just a
dangerous necessity?
It is not easy to grasp the true role of economics in modern history. Whole
volumes have been written about how money founded states and ruined them,
opened new horizons and enslaved millions, moved the wheels of industry and
drove hundreds of species into extinction. Yet to understand modern economic
history, you really need to understand just a single word. The word is growth. For
better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy has been growing
like a hormone-soused teenager. It eats up everything it can ɹnd and puts on
inches faster than you can count.
For most of history the economy stayed much the same size. Yes, global
production increased, but this was due mostly to demographic expansion and the
settlement of new lands. Per capita production remained static. But all that
changed in the modern age. In 1500, global production of goods and services was
equal to about $250 billion; today it hovers around $60 trillion. More importantly,
in 1500, annual per capita production averaged $550, while today every man,
woman and child produces, on the average, $8,800 a year.1 What accounts for this
stupendous growth?
Economics is a notoriously complicated subject. To make things easier, let’s
imagine a simple example.
Samuel Greedy, a shrewd financier, founds a bank in El Dorado, California.
A. A. Stone, an up-and-coming contractor in El Dorado, ɹnishes his ɹrst big job,
receiving payment in cash to the tune of $1 million. He deposits this sum in Mr
Greedy’s bank. The bank now has $1 million in capital.
In the meantime, Jane McDoughnut, an experienced but impecunious El Dorado
chef, thinks she sees a business opportunity – there’s no really good bakery in her
part of town. But she doesn’t have enough money of her own to buy a proper
facility complete with industrial ovens, sinks, knives and pots. She goes to the
bank, presents her business plan to Greedy, and persuades him that it’s a
worthwhile investment. He issues her a $1 million loan, by crediting her account

in the bank with that sum.
McDoughnut now hires Stone, the contractor, to build and furnish her bakery.
His price is $1,000,000.
When she pays him, with a cheque drawn on her account, Stone deposits it in
his account in the Greedy bank.
So how much money does Stone have in his bank account? Right, $2 million.
How much money, cash, is actually located in the bank’s safe? Yes, $1 million.
It doesn’t stop there. As contractors are wont to do, two months into the job
Stone informs McDoughnut that, due to unforeseen problems and expenses, the
bill for constructing the bakery will actually be $2 million. Mrs McDoughnut is not
pleased, but she can hardly stop the job in the middle. So she pays another visit to
the bank, convinces Mr Greedy to give her an additional loan, and he puts
another $1 million in her account. She transfers the money to the contractor’s
account.
How much money does Stone have in his account now? He’s got $3 million.
But how much money is actually sitting in the bank? Still just $1 million. In fact,
the same $1 million that’s been in the bank all along.
Current US banking law permits the bank to repeat this exercise seven more
times. The contractor would eventually have $10 million in his account, even
though the bank still has but $1 million in its vaults. Banks are allowed to loan
$10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the
money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes.2 If all of the
account holders at Barclays Bank suddenly demand their money, Barclays will
promptly collapse (unless the government steps in to save it). The same is true of
Lloyds, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, and all other banks in the world.
It sounds like a giant Ponzi scheme, doesn’t it? But if it’s a fraud, then the entire
modern economy is a fraud. The fact is, it’s not a deception, but rather a tribute to
the amazing abilities of the human imagination. What enables banks – and the
entire economy – to survive and ɻourish is our trust in the future. This trust is the
sole backing for most of the money in the world.
In the bakery example, the discrepancy between the contractor’s account
statement and the amount of money actually in the bank is Mrs McDoughnut’s
bakery. Mr Greedy has put the bank’s money into the asset, trusting that one day
it would be proɹtable. The bakery hasn’t baked a loaf of bread yet, but
McDoughnut and Greedy anticipate that a year hence it will be selling thousands
of loaves, rolls, cakes and cookies each day, at a handsome proɹt. Mrs
McDoughnut will then be able to repay her loan, with interest. If at that point Mr
Stone decides to withdraw his savings, Greedy will be able to come up with the
cash. The entire enterprise is thus founded on trust in an imaginary future – the
trust that the entrepreneur and the banker have in the bakery of their dreams,

along with the contractor’s trust in the future solvency of the bank.
We’ve already seen that money is an astounding thing because it can represent
myriad diʃerent objects and convert anything into almost anything else.
However, before the modern era this ability was limited. In most cases, money
could represent and convert only things that actually existed in the present. This
imposed a severe limitation on growth, since it made it very hard to ɹnance new
enterprises.
Consider our bakery again. Could McDoughnut get it built if money could
represent only tangible objects? No. In the present, she has a lot of dreams, but no
tangible resources. The only way she could get her bakery built would be to ɹnd a
contractor willing to work today and receive payment in a few years’ time, if and
when the bakery starts making money. Alas, such contractors are rare breeds. So
our entrepreneur is in a bind. Without a bakery, she can’t bake cakes. Without
cakes, she can’t make money. Without money, she can’t hire a contractor. Without
a contractor, she has no bakery.
Humankind was trapped in this predicament for thousands of years. As a result,
economies remained frozen. The way out of the trap was discovered only in the
modern era, with the appearance of a new system based on trust in the future. In
it, people agreed to represent imaginary goods – goods that do not exist in the
present – with a special kind of money they called ‘credit’. Credit enables us to
build the present at the expense of the future. It’s founded on the assumption that
our future resources are sure to be far more abundant than our present resources.
A host of new and wonderful opportunities open up if we can build things in the
present using future income.

If credit is such a wonderful thing, why did nobody think of it earlier? Of course
they did. Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known
human cultures, going back at least to ancient Sumer. The problem in previous
eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people
seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future
would be better than the present. They generally believed that times past had
been better than their own times and that the future would be worse, or at best
much the same. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total amount
of wealth was limited, if not dwindling. People therefore considered it a bad bet to
assume that they personally, or their kingdom, or the entire world, would be
producing more wealth ten years down the line. Business looked like a zero-sum
game. Of course, the proɹts of one particular bakery might rise, but only at the
expense of the bakery next door. Venice might ɻourish, but only by impoverishing
Genoa. The king of England might enrich himself, but only by robbing the king of
France. You could cut the pie in many different ways, but it never got any bigger.

That’s why many cultures concluded that making bundles of money was sinful.
As Jesus said, ‘It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for
a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God’ (Matthew 19:24). If the pie is static,
and I have a big part of it, then I must have taken somebody else’s slice. The rich
were obliged to do penance for their evil deeds by giving some of their surplus
wealth to charity.

The Entrepreneur’s Dilemma

If the global pie stayed the same size, there was no margin for credit. Credit is
the diʃerence between today’s pie and tomorrows pie. If the pie stays the same,
why extend credit? It would be an unacceptable risk unless you believed that the
baker or king asking for your money might be able to steal a slice from a
competitor. So it was hard to get a loan in the premodern world, and when you
got one it was usually small, short-term, and subject to high interest rates. Upstart
entrepreneurs thus found it diɽcult to open new bakeries and great kings who
wanted to build palaces or wage wars had no choice but to raise the necessary
funds through high taxes and tariffs.

The Magic Circle of the Modern Economy

That was ɹne for kings (as long as their subjects remained docile), but a scullery
maid who had a great idea for a bakery and wanted to move up in the world
generally could only dream of wealth while scrubbing down the royal kitchens
floors.
It was lose-lose. Because credit was limited, people had trouble ɹnancing new
businesses. Because there were few new businesses, the economy did not grow.
Because it did not grow, people assumed it never would, and those who had
capital were wary of extending credit. The expectation of stagnation fulɹlled
itself.

A Growing Pie

Then came the Scientiɹc Revolution and the idea of progress. The idea of progress
is built on the notion that if we admit our ignorance and invest resources in
research, things can improve. This idea was soon translated into economic terms.
Whoever believes in progress believes that geographical discoveries, technological
inventions and organisational developments can increase the sum total of human
production, trade and wealth. New trade routes in the Atlantic could ɻourish
without ruining old routes in the Indian Ocean. New goods could be produced
without reducing the production of old ones. For instance, one could open a new
bakery specialising in chocolate cakes and croissants without causing bakeries
specialising in bread to go bust. Everybody would simply develop new tastes and
eat more. I can be wealthy without your becoming poor; I can be obese without
your dying of hunger. The entire global pie can grow.
Over the last 500 years the idea of progress convinced people to put more and
more trust in the future. This trust created credit; credit brought real economic
growth; and growth strengthened the trust in the future and opened the way for
even more credit. It didn’t happen overnight – the economy behaved more like a
roller coaster than a balloon. But over the long run, with the bumps evened out,
the general direction was unmistakable. Today, there is so much credit in the
world that governments, business corporations and private individuals easily
obtain large, long-term and low-interest loans that far exceed current income.

The Economic History of the World in a Nutshell

The belief in the growing global pie eventually turned revolutionary. In 1776
the Scottish economist Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, probably the
most important economics manifesto of all time. In the eighth chapter of its ɹrst
volume, Smith made the following novel argument: when a landlord, a weaver, or
a shoemaker has greater proɹts than he needs to maintain his own family, he uses
the surplus to employ more assistants, in order to further increase his proɹts. The
more proɹts he has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase
in the proɹts of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective
wealth and prosperity.
This may not strike you as very original, because we all live in a capitalist
world that takes Smith’s argument for granted. We hear variations on this theme
every day in the news. Yet Smith’s claim that the selɹsh human urge to increase
private proɹts is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary
ideas in human history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but
even more so from a moral and political perspective. What Smith says is, in fact,
that greed is good, and that by becoming richer I beneɹt everybody, not just
myself. Egoism is altruism.
Smith taught people to think about the economy as a ‘win-win situation’, in
which my proɹts are also your proɹts. Not only can we both enjoy a bigger slice
of pie at the same time, but the increase in your slice depends upon the increase in
my slice. If I am poor, you too will be poor since I cannot buy your products or
services. If I am rich, you too will be enriched since you can now sell me
something. Smith denied the traditional contradiction between wealth and
morality, and threw open the gates of heaven for the rich. Being rich meant being
moral. In Smiths story, people become rich not by despoiling their neighbours, but
by increasing the overall size of the pie. And when the pie grows, everyone

beneɹts. The rich are accordingly the most useful and benevolent people in
society, because they turn the wheels of growth for everyone’s advantage.
All this depends, however, on the rich using their proɹts to open new factories
and hire new employees, rather than wasting them on non-productive activities.
Smith therefore repeated like a mantra the maxim that ‘When proɹts increase, the
landlord or weaver will employ more assistants’ and not ‘When proɹts increase,
Scrooge will hoard his money in a chest and take it out only to count his coins.’ A
crucial part of the modern capitalist economy was the emergence of a new ethic,
according to which proɹts ought to be reinvested in production. This brings about
more proɹts, which are again reinvested in production, which brings more proɹts,
et cetera ad inɹnitum. Investments can be made in many ways: enlarging the
factory, conducting scientiɹc research, developing new products. Yet all these
investments must somehow increase production and translate into larger proɹts.
In the new capitalist creed, the first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The profits
of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’
That’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’
from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are
invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or

wasted on unproductive activities. A pharaoh who pours resources into a non-
productive pyramid is not a capitalist. A pirate who loots a Spanish treasure ɻeet

and buries a chest full of glittering coins on the beach of some Caribbean island is
not a capitalist. But a hard-working factory hand who reinvests part of his income
in the stock market is.
The idea that ‘The proɹts of production must be reinvested in increasing
production’ sounds trivial. Yet it was alien to most people throughout history. In
premodern times, people believed that production was more or less constant. So
why reinvest your proɹts if production won’t increase by much, no matter what
you do? Thus medieval noblemen espoused an ethic of generosity and conspicuous
consumption. They spent their revenues on tournaments, banquets, palaces and
wars, and on charity and monumental cathedrals. Few tried to reinvest proɹts in
increasing their manors’ output, developing better kinds of wheat, or looking for
new markets.

In the modern era, the nobility has been overtaken by a new elite whose
members are true believers in the capitalist creed. The new capitalist elite is made
up not of dukes and marquises, but of board chairmen, stock traders and
industrialists. These magnates are far richer than the medieval nobility, but they
are far less interested in extravagant consumption, and they spend a much smaller
part of their profits on non-productive activities.
Medieval noblemen wore colourful robes of gold and silk, and devoted much of
their time to attending banquets, carnivals and glamorous tournaments. In
comparison, modern CEOs don dreary uniforms called suits that aʃord them all
the panache of a ɻock of crows, and they have little time for festivities. The
typical venture capitalist rushes from one business meeting to another, trying to
ɹgure out where to invest his capital and following the ups and downs of the
stocks and bonds he owns. True, his suits might be Versace and he might get to
travel in a private jet, but these expenses are nothing compared to what he invests
in increasing human production.
It’s not just Versace-clad business moguls who invest to increase productivity.
Ordinary folk and government agencies think along similar lines. How many
dinner conversations in modest neighbourhoods sooner or later bog down in
interminable debate about whether it is better to invest one’s savings in the stock
market, bonds or property? Governments too strive to invest their tax revenues in
productive enterprises that will increase future income – for example, building a
new port could make it easier for factories to export their products, enabling them
to make more taxable income, thereby increasing the government’s future
revenues. Another government might prefer to invest in education, on the grounds
that educated people form the basis for the lucrative high-tech industries, which
pay lots of taxes without needing extensive port facilities.
Capitalism began as a theory about how the economy functions. It was both

descriptive and prescriptive – it oʃered an account of how money worked and
promoted the idea that reinvesting proɹts in production leads to fast economic
growth. But capitalism gradually became far more than just an economic doctrine.
It now encompasses an ethic – a set of teachings about how people should behave,
educate their children and even think. Its principal tenet is that economic growth
is the supreme good, or at least a proxy for the supreme good, because justice,
freedom and even happiness all depend on economic growth. Ask a capitalist how
to bring justice and political freedom to a place like Zimbabwe or Afghanistan,
and you are likely to get a lecture on how economic aʀuence and a thriving
middle class are essential for stable democratic institutions, and about the need
therefore to inculcate Afghan tribesmen in the values of free enterprise, thrift and
self-reliance.
This new religion has had a decisive inɻuence on the development of modern
science, too. Scientiɹc research is usually funded by either governments or private
businesses. When capitalist governments and businesses consider investing in a
particular scientiɹc project, the ɹrst questions are usually, ‘Will this project enable
us to increase production and proɹts? Will it produce economic growth?’ A project
that can’t clear these hurdles has little chance of ɹnding a sponsor. No history of
modern science can leave capitalism out of the picture.
Conversely, the history of capitalism is unintelligible without taking science into
account. Capitalisms belief in perpetual economic growth ɻies in the face of
almost everything we know about the universe. A society of wolves would be
extremely foolish to believe that the supply of sheep would keep on growing
indeɹnitely. The human economy has nevertheless managed to grow
exponentially throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists
come up with another discovery or gadget every few years – such as the continent
of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep.
Banks and governments print money, but ultimately, it is the scientists who foot
the bill.
Over the last few years, banks and governments have been frenziedly printing
money. Everybody is terriɹed that the current economic crisis may stop the
growth of the economy. So they are creating trillions of dollars, euros and yen out
of thin air, pumping cheap credit into the system, and hoping that the scientists,
technicians and engineers will manage to come up with something really big,
before the bubble bursts. Everything depends on the people in the labs. New
discoveries in ɹelds such as biotechnology and nanotechnology could create entire
new industries, whose proɹts could back the trillions of make-believe money that
the banks and governments have created since 2008. If the labs do not fulɹl these
expectations before the bubble bursts, we are heading towards very rough times.

Columbus Searches for an Investor

Capitalism played a decisive role not only in the rise of modern science, but also
in the emergence of European imperialism. And it was European imperialism that
created the capitalist credit system in the ɹrst place. Of course, credit was not
invented in modern Europe. It existed in almost all agricultural societies, and in
the early modern period the emergence of European capitalism was closely linked
to economic developments in Asia. Remember, too, that until the late eighteenth
century, Asia was the world’s economic powerhouse, meaning that Europeans had
far less capital at their disposal than the Chinese, Muslims or Indians.
However, in the sociopolitical systems of China, India and the Muslim world,
credit played only a secondary role. Merchants and bankers in the markets of
Istanbul, Isfahan, Delhi and Beijing may have thought along capitalist lines, but
the kings and generals in the palaces and forts tended to despise merchants and
mercantile thinking. Most non-European empires of the early modern era were
established by great conquerors such as Nurhaci and Nader Shah, or by
bureaucratic and military elites as in the Qing and Ottoman empires. Financing
wars through taxes and plunder (without making ɹne distinctions between the
two), they owed little to credit systems, and they cared even less about the
interests of bankers and investors.
In Europe, on the other hand, kings and generals gradually adopted the
mercantile way of thinking, until merchants and bankers became the ruling elite.
The European conquest of the world was increasingly ɹnanced through credit
rather than taxes, and was increasingly directed by capitalists whose main
ambition was to receive maximum returns on their investments. The empires built
by bankers and merchants in frock coats and top hats defeated the empires built
by kings and noblemen in gold clothes and shining armour. The mercantile
empires were simply much shrewder in ɹnancing their conquests. Nobody wants
to pay taxes, but everyone is happy to invest.
In 1484 Christopher Columbus approached the king of Portugal with the
proposal that he ɹnance a ɻeet that would sail westward to ɹnd a new trade
route to East Asia. Such explorations were a very risky and costly business. A lot
of money was needed in order to build ships, buy supplies, and pay sailors and
soldiers – and there was no guarantee that the investment would yield a return.
The king of Portugal declined.
Like a present-day start-up entrepreneur, Columbus did not give up. He pitched
his idea to other potential investors in Italy, France, England, and again in
Portugal. Each time he was rejected. He then tried his luck with Ferdinand and
Isabella, rulers of newly united Spain. He took on some experienced lobbyists, and
with their help he managed to convince Queen Isabella to invest. As every school-

child knows, Isabella hit the jackpot. Columbus’ discoveries enabled the Spaniards
to conquer America, where they established gold and silver mines as well as sugar
and tobacco plantations that enriched the Spanish kings, bankers and merchants
beyond their wildest dreams.
A hundred years later, princes and bankers were willing to extend far more
credit to Columbus’ successors, and they had more capital at their disposal, thanks
to the treasures reaped from America. Equally important, princes and bankers had
far more trust in the potential of exploration, and were more willing to part with
their money. This was the magic circle of imperial capitalism: credit ɹnanced new
discoveries; discoveries led to colonies; colonies provided proɹts; proɹts built
trust; and trust translated into more credit. Nurhaci and Nader Shah ran out of fuel
after a few thousand kilometres. Capitalist entrepreneurs only increased their
financial momentum from conquest to conquest.
But these expeditions remained chancy aʃairs, so credit markets nevertheless
remained quite cautious. Many expeditions returned to Europe empty-handed,
having discovered nothing of value. The English, for instance, wasted a lot of
capital in fruitless attempts to discover a north-western passage to Asia through
the Arctic. Many other expeditions didn’t return at all. Ships hit icebergs,
foundered in tropical storms, or fell victim to pirates. In order to increase the
number of potential investors and reduce the risk they incurred, Europeans turned
to limited liability joint-stock companies. Instead of a single investor betting all
his money on a single rickety ship, the joint-stock company collected money from
a large number of investors, each risking only a small portion of his capital. The
risks were thereby curtailed, but no cap was placed on the proɹts. Even a small
investment in the right ship could turn you into a millionaire.
Decade by decade, western Europe witnessed the development of a sophisticated
ɹnancial system that could raise large amounts of credit on short notice and put it
at the disposal of private entrepreneurs and governments. This system could
ɹnance explorations and conquests far more eɽciently than any kingdom or
empire. The new-found power of credit can be seen in the bitter struggle between
Spain and the Netherlands. In the sixteenth century, Spain was the most powerful
state in Europe, holding sway over a vast global empire. It ruled much of Europe,
huge chunks of North and South America, the Philippine Islands, and a string of
bases along the coasts of Africa and Asia. Every year, ɻeets heavy with American
and Asian treasures returned to the ports of Seville and Cadiz. The Netherlands
was a small and windy swamp, devoid of natural resources, a small corner of the
king of Spain’s dominions.
In 1568 the Dutch, who were mainly Protestant, revolted against their Catholic
Spanish overlord. At ɹrst the rebels seemed to play the role of Don Quixote,
courageously tilting at invincible windmills. Yet within eighty years the Dutch had

not only secured their independence from Spain, but had managed to replace the
Spaniards and their Portuguese allies as masters of the ocean highways, build a
global Dutch empire, and become the richest state in Europe.
The secret of Dutch success was credit. The Dutch burghers, who had little taste
for combat on land, hired mercenary armies to ɹght the Spanish for them. The
Dutch themselves meanwhile took to the sea in ever-larger ɻeets. Mercenary
armies and cannon-brandishing ɻeets cost a fortune, but the Dutch were able to
ɹnance their military expeditions more easily than the mighty Spanish Empire
because they secured the trust of the burgeoning European ɹnancial system at a
time when the Spanish king was carelessly eroding its trust in him. Financiers
extended the Dutch enough credit to set up armies and ɻeets, and these armies
and ɻeets gave the Dutch control of world trade routes, which in turn yielded
handsome proɹts. The proɹts allowed the Dutch to repay the loans, which
strengthened the trust of the ɹnanciers. Amsterdam was fast becoming not only
one of the most important ports of Europe, but also the continent’s ɹnancial
Mecca.

How exactly did the Dutch win the trust of the ɹnancial system? Firstly, they were
sticklers about repaying their loans on time and in full, making the extension of
credit less risky for lenders. Secondly, their country’s judicial system enjoyed
independence and protected private rights – in particular private property rights.
Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals
and their property. Instead, it ɻows into states upholding the rule of law and
private property.
Imagine that you are the son of a solid family of German ɹnanciers. Your father
sees an opportunity to expand the business by opening branches in major
European cities. He sends you to Amsterdam and your younger brother to Madrid,
giving you each 10,000 gold coins to invest. Your brother lends his start-up capital
at interest to the king of Spain, who needs it to raise an army to ɹght the king of
France. You decide to lend yours to a Dutch merchant, who wants to invest in
scrubland on the southern end of a desolate island called Manhattan, certain that
property values there will skyrocket as the Hudson River turns into a major trade
artery. Both loans are to be repaid within a year.
The year passes. The Dutch merchant sells the land he’s bought at a handsome
markup and repays your money with the interest he promised. Your father is
pleased. But your little brother in Madrid is getting nervous. The war with France
ended well for the king of Spain, but he has now embroiled himself in a conɻict
with the Turks. He needs every penny to ɹnance the new war, and thinks this is
far more important than repaying old debts. Your brother sends letters to the
palace and asks friends with connections at court to intercede, but to no avail. Not

only has your brother not earned the promised interest – he’s lost the principal.
Your father is not pleased.
Now, to make matters worse, the king sends a treasury oɽcial to your brother
to tell him, in no uncertain terms, that he expects to receive another loan of the
same size, forthwith. Your brother has no money to lend. He writes home to Dad,
trying to persuade him that this time the king will come through. The
paterfamilias has a soft spot for his youngest, and agrees with a heavy heart.
Another 10,000 gold coins disappear into the Spanish treasury, never to be seen
again. Meanwhile in Amsterdam, things are looking bright. You make more and
more loans to enterprising Dutch merchants, who repay them promptly and in
full. But your luck does not hold indefinitely. One of your usual clients has a hunch
that wooden clogs are going to be the next fashion craze in Paris, and asks you for
a loan to set up a footwear emporium in the French capital. You lend him the
money, but unfortunately the clogs don’t catch on with the French ladies, and the
disgruntled merchant refuses to repay the loan.
Your father is furious, and tells both of you it is time to unleash the lawyers.
Your brother ɹles suit in Madrid against the Spanish monarch, while you ɹle suit
in Amsterdam against the erstwhile wooden-shoe wizard. In Spain, the law courts
are subservient to the king – the judges serve at his pleasure and fear punishment
if they do not do his will. In the Netherlands, the courts are a separate branch of
government, not dependent on the country’s burghers and princes. The court in
Madrid throws out your brother’s suit, while the court in Amsterdam ɹnds in your
favour and puts a lien on the clog-merchant’s assets to force him to pay up. Your
father has learned his lesson. Better to do business with merchants than with
kings, and better to do it in Holland than in Madrid.
And your brother’s travails are not over. The king of Spain desperately needs
more money to pay his army. He’s sure that your father has cash to spare. So he
brings trumped-up treason charges against your brother. If he doesn’t come up
with 20,000 gold coins forthwith, he’ll get cast into a dungeon and rot there until
he dies.
Your father has had enough. He pays the ransom for his beloved son, but swears
never to do business in Spain again. He closes his Madrid branch and relocates
your brother to Rotterdam. Two branches in Holland now look like a really good
idea. He hears that even Spanish capitalists are smuggling their fortunes out of
their country. They, too, realise that if they want to keep their money and use it to
gain more wealth, they are better oʃ investing it where the rule of law prevails
and where private property is respected – in the Netherlands, for example.
In such ways did the king of Spain squander the trust of investors at the same
time that Dutch merchants gained their conɹdence. And it was the Dutch
merchants – not the Dutch state – who built the Dutch Empire. The king of Spain

kept on trying to ɹnance and maintain his conquests by raising unpopular taxes
from a disgruntled populace. The Dutch merchants ɹnanced conquest by getting
loans, and increasingly also by selling shares in their companies that entitled their
holders to receive a portion of the company’s proɹts. Cautious investors who
would never have given their money to the king of Spain, and who would have
thought twice before extending credit to the Dutch government, happily invested
fortunes in the Dutch joint-stock companies that were the mainstay of the new
empire.
If you thought a company was going to make a big proɹt but it had already sold
all its shares, you could buy some from people who owned them, probably for a
higher price than they originally paid. If you bought shares and later discovered
that the company was in dire straits, you could try to unload your stock for a
lower price. The resulting trade in company shares led to the establishment in
most major European cities of stock exchanges, places where the shares of
companies were traded.
The most famous Dutch joint-stock company, the Vereenigde Oostindische
Compagnie, or VOC for short, was chartered in 1602, just as the Dutch were
throwing oʃ Spanish rule and the boom of Spanish artillery could still be heard
not far from Amsterdam’s ramparts. VOC used the money it raised from selling
shares to build ships, send them to Asia, and bring back Chinese, Indian and
Indonesian goods. It also ɹnanced military actions taken by company ships
against competitors and pirates. Eventually VOC money ɹnanced the conquest of
Indonesia.
Indonesia is the world’s biggest archipelago. Its thousands upon thousands of
islands were ruled in the early seventeenth century by hundreds of kingdoms,
principalities, sultanates and tribes. When VOC merchants ɹrst arrived in
Indonesia in 1603, their aims were strictly commercial. However, in order to
secure their commercial interests and maximise the proɹts of the shareholders,
VOC merchants began to ɹght against local potentates who charged inɻated
tariʃs, as well as against European competitors. VOC armed its merchant ships
with cannons; it recruited European, Japanese, Indian and Indonesian
mercenaries; and it built forts and conducted full-scale battles and sieges. This
enterprise may sound a little strange to us, but in the early modern age it was
common for private companies to hire not only soldiers, but also generals and
admirals, cannons and ships, and even entire oʃ-the-shelf armies. The
international community took this for granted and didn’t raise an eyebrow when a
private company established an empire.
Island after island fell to VOC mercenaries and a large part of Indonesia
became a VOC colony. VOC ruled Indonesia for close to 200 years. Only in 1800
did the Dutch state assume control of Indonesia, making it a Dutch national

colony for the following 150 years. Today some people warn that twenty-ɹrst-
century corporations are accumulating too much power. Early modern history

shows just how far that can go if businesses are allowed to pursue their self-
interest unchecked.

While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or
WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River,
WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth.
The colony was threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who
eventually captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York. The
remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and British
are today paved over by the world’s most famous street – Wall Street.

As the seventeenth century wound to an end, complacency and costly continental
wars caused the Dutch to lose not only New York, but also their place as Europe’s
ɹnancial and imperial engine. The vacancy was hotly contested by France and
Britain. At ɹrst France seemed to be in a far stronger position. It was bigger than
Britain, richer, more populous, and it possessed a larger and more experienced
army. Yet Britain managed to win the trust of the financial system whereas France
proved itself unworthy. The behaviour of the French crown was particularly
notorious during what was called the Mississippi Bubble, the largest ɹnancial
crisis of eighteenth-century Europe. That story also begins with an empire-building
joint-stock company.
In 1717 the Mississippi Company, chartered in France, set out to colonise the
lower Mississippi valley, establishing the city of New Orleans in the process. To
finance its ambitious plans, the company, which had good connections at the court
of King Louis XV, sold shares on the Paris stock exchange. John Law, the
company’s director, was also the governor of the central bank of France.
Furthermore, the king had appointed him controller-general of ɹnances, an oɽce
roughly equivalent to that of a modern ɹnance minister. In 1717 the lower
Mississippi valley oʃered few attractions besides swamps and alligators, yet the
Mississippi Company spread tales of fabulous riches and boundless opportunities.
French aristocrats, businessmen and the stolid members of the urban bourgeoisie
fell for these fantasies, and Mississippi share prices skyrocketed. Initially, shares
were oʃered at 500 livres apiece. On 1 August 1719, shares traded at 2,750 livres.
By 30 August, they were worth 4,100 livres, and on 4 September, they reached
5,000 livres. On 2 December the price of a Mississippi share crossed the threshold
of 10,000 livres. Euphoria swept the streets of Paris. People sold all their
possessions and took huge loans in order to buy Mississippi shares. Everybody
believed they’d discovered the easy way to riches.

39. New Amsterdam in 1660, at the tip of Manhattan Island. The settlement’s protective wall is today

paved over by Wall Street.

A few days later, the panic began. Some speculators realised that the share
prices were totally unrealistic and unsustainable. They figured that they had better
sell while stock prices were at their peak. As the supply of shares available rose,
their price declined. When other investors saw the price going down, they also
wanted to get out quick. The stock price plummeted further, setting oʃ an
avalanche. In order to stabilise prices, the central bank of France – at the
direction of its governor, John Law – bought up Mississippi shares, but it could not
do so for ever. Eventually it ran out of money. When this happened, the
controller-general of finances, the same John Law, authorised the printing of more
money in order to buy additional shares. This placed the entire French ɹnancial
system inside the bubble. And not even this ɹnancial wizardry could save the day.
The price of Mississippi shares dropped from 10,000 livres back to 1,000 livres,
and then collapsed completely, and the shares lost every sou of their worth. By
now, the central bank and the royal treasury owned a huge amount of worthless
stock and had no money. The big speculators emerged largely unscathed – they
had sold in time. Small investors lost everything, and many committed suicide.
The Mississippi Bubble was one of history’s most spectacular ɹnancial crashes.
The royal French ɹnancial system never recuperated fully from the blow. The way
in which the Mississippi Company used its political clout to manipulate share
prices and fuel the buying frenzy caused the public to lose faith in the French

banking system and in the ɹnancial wisdom of the French king. Louis XV found it
more and more diɽcult to raise credit. This became one of the chief reasons that
the overseas French Empire fell into British hands. While the British could borrow
money easily and at low interest rates, France had diɽculties securing loans, and
had to pay high interest on them. In order to ɹnance his growing debts, the king
of France borrowed more and more money at higher and higher interest rates.
Eventually, in the 1780s, Louis XVI, who had ascended to the throne on his
grandfather’s death, realised that half his annual budget was tied to servicing the
interest on his loans, and that he was heading towards bankruptcy. Reluctantly, in
1789, Louis XVI convened the Estates General, the French parliament that had not
met for a century and a half, in order to ɹnd a solution to the crisis. Thus began
the French Revolution.
While the French overseas empire was crumbling, the British Empire was
expanding rapidly. Like the Dutch Empire before it, the British Empire was
established and run largely by private joint-stock companies based in the London
stock exchange. The ɹrst English settlements in North America were established in
the early seventeenth century by joint-stock companies such as the London
Company, the Plymouth Company, the Dorchester Company and the
Massachusetts Company.
The Indian subcontinent too was conquered not by the British state, but by the
mercenary army of the British East India Company. This company outperformed
even the VOC. From its headquarters in Leadenhall Street, London, it ruled a
mighty Indian empire for about a century, maintaining a huge military force of up
to 350,000 soldiers, considerably outnumbering the armed forces of the British
monarchy. Only in 1858 did the British crown nationalise India along with the
company’s private army. Napoleon made fun of the British, calling them a nation
of shopkeepers. Yet these shopkeepers defeated Napoleon himself, and their
empire was the largest the world has ever seen.

In the Name of Capital

The nationalisation of Indonesia by the Dutch crown (1800) and of India by the
British crown (1858) hardly ended the embrace of capitalism and empire. On the

contrary, the connection only grew stronger during the nineteenth century. Joint-
stock companies no longer needed to establish and govern private colonies – their

managers and large shareholders now pulled the strings of power in London,
Amsterdam and Paris, and they could count on the state to look after their
interests. As Marx and other social critics quipped, Western governments were

becoming a capitalist trade union.
The most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of big money
was the First Opium War, fought between Britain and China (1840–42). In the
ɹrst half of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company and sundry
British business people made fortunes by exporting drugs, particularly opium, to
China. Millions of Chinese became addicts, debilitating the country both
economically and socially. In the late 1830s the Chinese government issued a ban
on drug traɽcking, but British drug merchants simply ignored the law. Chinese
authorities began to conɹscate and destroy drug cargos. The drug cartels had close
connections in Westminster and Downing Street – many MPs and Cabinet
ministers in fact held stock in the drug companies – so they pressured the
government to take action.
In 1840 Britain duly declared war on China in the name of ‘free trade’. It was a
walkover. The overconɹdent Chinese were no match for Britain’s new wonder
weapons – steamboats, heavy artillery, rockets and rapid-ɹre riɻes. Under the
subsequent peace treaty, China agreed not to constrain the activities of British
drug merchants and to compensate them for damages inɻicted by the Chinese
police. Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong Kong,
which they proceeded to use as a secure base for drug traɽcking (Hong Kong
remained in British hands until 1997). In the late nineteenth century, about 40
million Chinese, a tenth of the country’s population, were opium addicts.3
Egypt, too, learned to respect the long arm of British capitalism. During the
nineteenth century, French and British investors lent huge sums to the rulers of
Egypt, ɹrst in order to ɹnance the Suez Canal project, and later to fund far less
successful enterprises. Egyptian debt swelled, and European creditors increasingly
meddled in Egyptian aʃairs. In 1881 Egyptian nationalists had had enough and
rebelled. They declared a unilateral abrogation of all foreign debt. Queen Victoria
was not amused. A year later she dispatched her army and navy to the Nile and
Egypt remained a British protectorate until after World War Two.

These were hardly the only wars fought in the interests of investors. In fact, war
itself could become a commodity, just like opium. In 1821 the Greeks rebelled
against the Ottoman Empire. The uprising aroused great sympathy in liberal and
romantic circles in Britain – Lord Byron, the poet, even went to Greece to ɹght
alongside the insurgents. But London ɹnanciers saw an opportunity as well. They
proposed to the rebel leaders the issue of tradable Greek Rebellion Bonds on the
London stock exchange. The Greeks would promise to repay the bonds, plus
interest, if and when they won their independence. Private investors bought bonds
to make a proɹt, or out of sympathy for the Greek cause, or both. The value of
Greek Rebellion Bonds rose and fell on the London stock exchange in tempo with

military successes and failures on the battleɹelds of Hellas. The Turks gradually
gained the upper hand. With a rebel defeat imminent, the bondholders faced the
prospect of losing their trousers. The bondholders’ interest was the national
interest, so the British organised an international ɻeet that, in 1827, sank the
main Ottoman ɻotilla in the Battle of Navarino. After centuries of subjugation,
Greece was ɹnally free. But freedom came with a huge debt that the new country
had no way of repaying. The Greek economy was mortgaged to British creditors
for decades to come.
The bear hug between capital and politics has had far-reaching implications for
the credit market. The amount of credit in an economy is determined not only by
purely economic factors such as the discovery of a new oil ɹeld or the invention of
a new machine, but also by political events such as regime changes or more
ambitious foreign policies. After the Battle of Navarino, British capitalists were
more willing to invest their money in risky overseas deals. They had seen that if a
foreign debtor refused to repay loans, Her Majesty’s army would get their money
back.
This is why today a country’s credit rating is far more important to its economic
well-being than are its natural resources. Credit ratings indicate the probability
that a country will pay its debts. In addition to purely economic data, they take
into account political, social and even cultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed
with a despotic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will
usually receive a low credit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor
since it will not be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil
bounty. A country devoid of natural resources, but which enjoys peace, a fair
judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high credit rating. As
such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to support a good education
system and foster a flourishing high-tech industry.

The Cult of the Free Market

Capital and politics inɻuence each other to such an extent that their relations are
hotly debated by economists, politicians and the general public alike. Ardent
capitalists tend to argue that capital should be free to inɻuence politics, but
politics should not be allowed to inɻuence capital. They argue that when
governments interfere in the markets, political interests cause them to make
unwise investments that result in slower growth. For example, a government may
impose heavy taxation on industrialists and use the money to give lavish
unemployment beneɹts, which are popular with voters. In the view of many

business people, it would be far better if the government left the money with
them. They would use it, they claim, to open new factories and hire the
unemployed.
In this view, the wisest economic policy is to keep politics out of the economy,
reduce taxation and government regulation to a minimum, and allow market
forces free rein to take their course. Private investors, unencumbered by political
considerations, will invest their money where they can get the most proɹt, so the
way to ensure the most economic growth – which will beneɹt everyone,
industrialists and workers – is for the government to do as little as possible. This
free-market doctrine is today the most common and inɻuential variant of the
capitalist creed. The most enthusiastic advocates of the free market criticise
military adventures abroad with as much zeal as welfare programmes at home.
They oʃer governments the same advice that Zen masters oʃer initiates: just do
nothing.
But in its extreme form, belief in the free market is as naïve as belief in Santa
Claus. There simply is no such thing as a market free of all political bias. The most
important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly
threatened by thieves and charlatans. Markets by themselves oʃer no protection
against fraud, theft and violence. It is the job of political systems to ensure trust
by legislating sanctions against cheats and to establish and support police forces,
courts and jails which will enforce the law. When kings fail to do their jobs and
regulate the markets properly, it leads to loss of trust, dwindling credit and
economic depression. That was the lesson taught by the Mississippi Bubble of
1719, and anyone who forgot it was reminded by the US housing bubble of 2007,
and the ensuing credit crunch and recession.

The Capitalist Hell

There is an even more fundamental reason why it’s dangerous to give markets a
completely free rein. Adam Smith taught that the shoemaker would use his surplus
to employ more assistants. This implies that egoistic greed is beneɹcial for all,
since profits are utilised to expand production and hire more employees.
Yet what happens if the greedy shoemaker increases his proɹts by paying
employees less and increasing their work hours? The standard answer is that the
free market would protect the employees. If our shoemaker pays too little and
demands too much, the best employees would naturally abandon him and go to
work for his competitors. The tyrant shoemaker would ɹnd himself left with the
worst labourers, or with no labourers at all. He would have to mend his ways or

go out of business. His own greed would compel him to treat his employees well.
This sounds bulletproof in theory, but in practice the bullets get through all too
easily. In a completely free market, unsupervised by kings and priests, avaricious
capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces. If there is
a single corporation controlling all shoe factories in a country, or if all factory
owners conspire to reduce wages simultaneously, then the labourers are no longer
able to protect themselves by switching jobs.
Even worse, greedy bosses might curtail the workers’ freedom of movement
through debt peonage or slavery. At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was
almost unknown in Christian Europe. During the early modern period, the rise of
European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade.
Unrestrained market forces, rather than tyrannical kings or racist ideologues,
were responsible for this calamity.
When the Europeans conquered America, they opened gold and silver mines and
established sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations. These mines and plantations
became the mainstay of American production and export. The sugar plantations
were particularly important. In the Middle Ages, sugar was a rare luxury in
Europe. It was imported from the Middle East at prohibitive prices and used
sparingly as a secret ingredient in delicacies and snake-oil medicines. After large
sugar plantations were established in America, ever-increasing amounts of sugar
began to reach Europe. The price of sugar dropped and Europe developed an
insatiable sweet tooth. Entrepreneurs met this need by producing huge quantities
of sweets: cakes, cookies, chocolate, candy, and sweetened beverages such as
cocoa, coʃee and tea. The annual sugar intake of the average Englishman rose
from near zero in the early seventeenth century to around eight kilograms in the
early nineteenth century.
However, growing cane and extracting its sugar was a labour-intensive
business. Few people wanted to work long hours in malaria-infested sugar ɹelds
under a tropical sun. Contract labourers would have produced a commodity too
expensive for mass consumption. Sensitive to market forces, and greedy for proɹts
and economic growth, European plantation owners switched to slaves.
From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million African slaves
were imported to America. About 70 per cent of them worked on the sugar
plantations. Labour conditions were abominable. Most slaves lived a short and
miserable life, and millions more died during wars waged to capture slaves or
during the long voyage from inner Africa to the shores of America. All this so that
Europeans could enjoy their sweet tea and candy – and sugar barons could enjoy
huge profits.
The slave trade was not controlled by any state or government. It was a purely
economic enterprise, organised and ɹnanced by the free market according to the

laws of supply and demand. Private slave-trading companies sold shares on the
Amsterdam, London and Paris stock exchanges. Middle-class Europeans looking
for a good investment bought these shares. Relying on this money, the companies
bought ships, hired sailors and soldiers, purchased slaves in Africa, and
transported them to America. There they sold the slaves to the plantation owners,
using the proceeds to purchase plantation products such as sugar, cocoa, coʃee,
tobacco, cotton and rum. They returned to Europe, sold the sugar and cotton for a
good price, and then sailed to Africa to begin another round. The shareholders
were very pleased with this arrangement. Throughout the eighteenth century the
yield on slave-trade investments was about 6 per cent a year – they were
extremely profitable, as any modern consultant would be quick to admit.
This is the ɻy in the ointment of free-market capitalism. It cannot ensure that
proɹts are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner. On the contrary,
the craving to increase proɹts and production blinds people to anything that
might stand in the way. When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by
any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe. Some religions,
such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred.
Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indiʃerence coupled with greed. The
Atlantic slave trade did not stem from racist hatred towards Africans. The
individuals who bought the shares, the brokers who sold them, and the managers
of the slave-trade companies rarely thought about the Africans. Nor did the owners
of the sugar plantations. Many owners lived far from their plantations, and the
only information they demanded were neat ledgers of profits and losses.
It is important to remember that the Atlantic slave trade was not a single
aberration in an otherwise spotless record. The Great Bengal Famine, discussed in
the previous chapter, was caused by a similar dynamic – the British East India
Company cared more about its proɹts than about the lives of 10 million Bengalis.
VOC’s military campaigns in Indonesia were ɹnanced by upstanding Dutch
burghers who loved their children, gave to charity, and enjoyed good music and
ɹne art, but had no regard for the suʃering of the inhabitants of Java, Sumatra
and Malacca. Countless other crimes and misdemeanours accompanied the growth
of the modern economy in other parts of the planet.

The nineteenth century brought no improvement in the ethics of capitalism. The

Industrial Revolution that swept through Europe enriched the bankers and capital-
owners, but condemned millions of workers to a life of abject poverty. In the

European colonies things were even worse. In 1876, King Leopold II of Belgium
set up a nongovernmental humanitarian organisation with the declared aim of
exploring Central Africa and ɹghting the slave trade along the Congo River. It
was also charged with improving conditions for the inhabitants of the region by

building roads, schools and hospitals. In 1885 the European powers agreed to give
this organisation control of 2.3 million square kilometres in the Congo basin. This
territory, seventy-ɹve times the size of Belgium, was henceforth known as the
Congo Free State. Nobody asked the opinion of the territory’s 20–30 million
inhabitants.
Within a short time the humanitarian organisation became a business enterprise
whose real aim was growth and proɹt. The schools and hospitals were forgotten,
and the Congo basin was instead ɹlled with mines and plantations, run by mostly
Belgian oɽcials who ruthlessly exploited the local population. The rubber industry
was particularly notorious. Rubber was fast becoming an industrial staple, and
rubber export was the Congo’s most important source of income. The African
villagers who collected the rubber were required to provide higher and higher
quotas. Those who failed to deliver their quota were punished brutally for their
‘laziness’. Their arms were chopped oʃ and occasionally entire villages were
massacred. According to the most moderate estimates, between 1885 and 1908 the
pursuit of growth and proɹts cost the lives of 6 million individuals (at least 20 per
cent of the Congo’s population). Some estimates reach up to 10 million deaths.4
After 1908, and especially after 1945, capitalist greed was somewhat reined in,
not least due to the fear of Communism. Yet inequities are still rampant. The
economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500, but it is distributed so
unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after
a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like
the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn
out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well
keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.
Capitalism has two answers to this criticism. First, capitalism has created a
world that nobody but a capitalist is capable of running. The only serious attempt
to manage the world diʃerently – Communism – was so much worse in almost
every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again. In 8500 BC one
could cry bitter tears over the Agricultural Revolution, but it was too late to give
up agriculture. Similarly, we may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without
it.
The second answer is that we just need more patience – paradise, the capitalists
promise, is right around the corner. True, mistakes have been made, such as the
Atlantic slave trade and the exploitation of the European working class. But we
have learned our lesson, and if we just wait a little longer and allow the pie to
grow a little bigger, everybody will receive a fatter slice. The division of spoils
will never be equitable, but there will be enough to satisfy every man, woman and
child – even in the Congo.
There are, indeed, some positive signs. At least when we use purely material

criteria – such as life expectancy, child mortality and calorie intake – the standard
of living of the average human in 2014 is signiɹcantly higher than it was in 1914,
despite the exponential growth in the number of humans.
Yet can the economic pie grow indeɹnitely? Every pie requires raw materials
and energy. Prophets of doom warn that sooner or later Homo sapiens will exhaust
the raw materials and energy of planet Earth. And what will happen then?

The Wheels of Industry

THE MODERN ECONOMY GROWS THANKS to our trust in the future and to the
willingness of capitalists to reinvest their proɹts in production. Yet that does not
suɽce. Economic growth also requires energy and raw materials, and these are
finite. When and if they run out, the entire system will collapse.
But the evidence provided by the past is that they are ɹnite only in theory.
Counter-intuitively, while humankind’s use of energy and raw materials has
mushroomed in the last few centuries, the amounts available for our exploitation
have actually increased. Whenever a shortage of either has threatened to slow
economic growth, investments have ɻowed into scientiɹc and technological
research. These have invariably produced not only more eɽcient ways of
exploiting existing resources, but also completely new types of energy and
materials.
Consider the vehicle industry. Over the last 300 years, humankind has
manufactured billions of vehicles – from carts and wheelbarrows, to trains, cars,
supersonic jets and space shuttles. One might have expected that such a prodigious
eʃort would have exhausted the energy sources and raw materials available for
vehicle production, and that today we would be scraping the bottom of the barrel.
Yet the opposite is the case. Whereas in 1700 the global vehicle industry relied
overwhelmingly on wood and iron, today it has at its disposal a cornucopia of
new-found materials such as plastic, rubber, aluminium and titanium, none of
which our ancestors even knew about. Whereas in 1700 carts were built mainly by
the muscle power of carpenters and smiths, today the machines in Toyota and
Boeing factories are powered by petroleum combustion engines and nuclear
power stations. A similar revolution has swept almost all other ɹelds of industry.
We call it the Industrial Revolution.

For millennia prior to the Industrial Revolution, humans already knew how to
make use of a large variety of energy sources. They burned wood in order to smelt
iron, heat houses and bake cakes. Sailing ships harnessed wind power to move
around, and watermills captured the ɻow of rivers to grind grain. Yet all these
had clear limits and problems. Trees were not available everywhere, the wind

didn’t always blow when you needed it, and water power was only useful if you
lived near a river.
An even bigger problem was that people didn’t know how to convert one type
of energy into another. They could harness the movement of wind and water to
sail ships and push millstones, but not to heat water or smelt iron. Conversely,
they could not use the heat energy produced by burning wood to make a millstone
move. Humans had only one machine capable of performing such energy
conversion tricks: the body. In the natural process of metabolism, the bodies of
humans and other animals burn organic fuels known as food and convert the
released energy into the movement of muscles. Men, women and beasts could
consume grain and meat, burn up their carbohydrates and fats, and use the energy
to haul a rickshaw or pull a plough.
Since human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion device
available, muscle power was the key to almost all human activities. Human
muscles built carts and houses, ox muscles ploughed ɹelds, and horse muscles
transported goods. The energy that fuelled these organic muscle-machines came
ultimately from a single source – plants. Plants in their turn obtained their energy
from the sun. By the process of photosynthesis, they captured solar energy and
packed it into organic compounds. Almost everything people did throughout
history was fuelled by solar energy that was captured by plants and converted
into muscle power.
Human history was consequently dominated by two main cycles: the growth
cycles of plants and the changing cycles of solar energy (day and night, summer
and winter). When sunlight was scarce and when wheat ɹelds were still green,
humans had little energy. Granaries were empty, tax collectors were idle, soldiers
found it diɽcult to move and ɹght, and kings tended to keep the peace. When the
sun shone brightly and the wheat ripened, peasants harvested the crops and ɹlled
the granaries. Tax collectors hurried to take their share. Soldiers ɻexed their
muscles and sharpened their swords. Kings convened councils and planned their
next campaigns. Everyone was fuelled by solar energy – captured and packaged
in wheat, rice and potatoes.

The Secret in the Kitchen

Throughout these long millennia, day in and day out, people stood face to face
with the most important invention in the history of energy production – and failed
to notice it. It stared them in the eye every time a housewife or servant put up a
kettle to boil water for tea or put a pot full of potatoes on the stove. The minute

the water boiled, the lid of the kettle or the pot jumped. Heat was being converted
to movement. But jumping pot lids were an annoyance, especially if you forgot
the pot on the stove and the water boiled over. Nobody saw their real potential.
A partial breakthrough in converting heat into movement followed the
invention of gunpowder in ninth-century China. At ɹrst, the idea of using
gunpowder to propel projectiles was so counter-intuitive that for centuries
gunpowder was used primarily to produce ɹre bombs. But eventually – perhaps
after some bomb expert ground gunpowder in a mortar only to have the pestle
shoot out with force – guns made their appearance. About 600 years passed
between the invention of gunpowder and the development of effective artillery.

Even then, the idea of converting heat into motion remained so counter-
intuitive that another three centuries went by before people invented the next

machine that used heat to move things around. The new technology was born in
British coal mines. As the British population swelled, forests were cut down to fuel
the growing economy and make way for houses and ɹelds. Britain suʃered from
an increasing shortage of ɹrewood. It began burning coal as a substitute. Many
coal seams were located in waterlogged areas, and ɻooding prevented miners
from accessing the lower strata of the mines. It was a problem looking for a
solution. Around 1700, a strange noise began reverberating around British
mineshafts. That noise – harbinger of the Industrial Revolution – was subtle at
ɹrst, but it grew louder and louder with each passing decade until it enveloped the
entire world in a deafening cacophony. It emanated from a steam engine.
There are many types of steam engines, but they all share one common
principle. You burn some kind of fuel, such as coal, and use the resulting heat to
boil water, producing steam. As the steam expands it pushes a piston. The piston
moves, and anything that is connected to the piston moves with it. You have
converted heat into movement! In eighteenth-century British coal mines, the
piston was connected to a pump that extracted water from the bottom of the
mineshafts. The earliest engines were incredibly ineɽcient. You needed to burn a
huge load of coal in order to pump out even a tiny amount of water. But in the
mines coal was plentiful and close at hand, so nobody cared.
In the decades that followed, British entrepreneurs improved the eɽciency of
the steam engine, brought it out of the mineshafts, and connected it to looms and

gins. This revolutionised textile production, making it possible to produce ever-
larger quantities of cheap textiles. In the blink of an eye, Britain became the

workshop of the world. But even more importantly, getting the steam engine out
of the mines broke an important psychological barrier. If you could burn coal in
order to move textile looms, why not use the same method to move other things,
such as vehicles?
In 1825, a British engineer connected a steam engine to a train of mine wagons

full of coal. The engine drew the wagons along an iron rail some twenty

kilometres long from the mine to the nearest harbour. This was the ɹrst steam-
powered locomotive in history. Clearly, if steam could be used to transport coal,

why not other goods? And why not even people? On 15 September 1830, the ɹrst
commercial railway line was opened, connecting Liverpool with Manchester. The
trains moved under the same steam power that had previously pumped water and
moved textile looms. A mere twenty years later, Britain had tens of thousands of
kilometres of railway tracks.1
Henceforth, people became obsessed with the idea that machines and engines
could be used to convert one type of energy into another. Any type of energy,
anywhere in the world, might be harnessed to whatever need we had, if we could
just invent the right machine. For example, when physicists realised that an
immense amount of energy is stored within atoms, they immediately started
thinking about how this energy could be released and used to make electricity,
power submarines and annihilate cities. Six hundred years passed between the
moment Chinese alchemists discovered gunpowder and the moment Turkish
cannon pulverised the walls of Constantinople. Only forty years passed between
the moment Einstein determined that any kind of mass could be converted into
energy – that’s what E = mc2 means – and the moment atom bombs obliterated
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nuclear power stations mushroomed all over the
globe.
Another crucial discovery was the internal combustion engine, which took little
more than a generation to revolutionise human transportation and turn petroleum
into liquid political power. Petroleum had been known for thousands of years, and
was used to waterproof roofs and lubricate axles. Yet until just a century ago
nobody thought it was useful for much more than that. The idea of spilling blood
for the sake of oil would have seemed ludicrous. You might ɹght a war over land,
gold, pepper or slaves, but not oil.
The career of electricity was more startling yet. Two centuries ago electricity
played no role in the economy, and was used at most for arcane scientiɹc
experiments and cheap magic tricks. A series of inventions turned it into our
universal genie in a lamp. We ɻick our ɹngers and it prints books and sews
clothes, keeps our vegetables fresh and our ice cream frozen, cooks our dinners
and executes our criminals, registers our thoughts and records our smiles, lights up
our nights and entertains us with countless television shows. Few of us understand
how electricity does all these things, but even fewer can imagine life without it.

An Ocean of Energy

At heart, the Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. It
has demonstrated again and again that there is no limit to the amount of energy
at our disposal. Or, more precisely, that the only limit is set by our ignorance.
Every few decades we discover a new energy source, so that the sum total of
energy at our disposal just keeps growing.
Why are so many people afraid that we are running out of energy? Why do they
warn of disaster if we exhaust all available fossil fuels? Clearly the world does not
lack energy. All we lack is the knowledge necessary to harness and convert it to
our needs. The amount of energy stored in all the fossil fuel on earth is negligible
compared to the amount that the sun dispenses every day, free of charge. Only a
tiny proportion of the sun’s energy reaches us, yet it amounts to 3,766,800
exajoules of energy each year (a joule is a unit of energy in the metric system,
about the amount you expend to lift a small apple one yard straight up; an
exajoule is a billion billion joules – that’s a lot of apples).2 All the world’s plants
capture only about 3,000 of those solar exajoules through the process of
photosynthesis.3 All human activities and industries put together consume about
500 exajoules annually, equivalent to the amount of energy earth receives from
the sun in just ninety minutes.4 And that’s only solar energy. In addition, we are
surrounded by other enormous sources of energy, such as nuclear energy and
gravitational energy, the latter most evident in the power of the ocean tides
caused by the moon’s pull on the earth.
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the human energy market was almost
completely dependent on plants. People lived alongside a green energy reservoir
carrying 3,000 exajoules a year, and tried to pump as much of its energy as they
could. Yet there was a clear limit to how much they could extract. During the
Industrial Revolution, we came to realise that we are actually living alongside an
enormous ocean of energy, one holding billions upon billions of exajoules of
potential power. All we need to do is invent better pumps.

Learning how to harness and convert energy eʃectively solved the other problem
that slows economic growth – the scarcity of raw materials. As humans worked out
how to harness large quantities of cheap energy, they could begin exploiting
previously inaccessible deposits of raw materials (for example, mining iron in the
Siberian wastelands), or transporting raw materials from ever more distant
locations (for example, supplying a British textile mill with Australian wool).
Simultaneously, scientiɹc breakthroughs enabled humankind to invent completely
new raw materials, such as plastic, and discover previously unknown natural

materials, such as silicon and aluminium.
Chemists discovered aluminium only in the 1820s, but separating the metal from
its ore was extremely diɽcult and costly. For decades, aluminium was much more
expensive than gold. In the 1860S, Emperor Napoleon III of France commissioned
aluminium cutlery to be laid out for his most distinguished guests. Less important
visitors had to make do with the gold knives and forks.5 But at the end of the
nineteenth century chemists discovered a way to extract immense amounts of
cheap aluminium, and current global production stands at 30 million tons per
year. Napoleon III would be surprised to hear that his subjects’ descendants use
cheap disposable aluminium foil to wrap their sandwiches and put away their
leftovers.
Two thousand years ago, when people in the Mediterranean basin suʃered from
dry skin they smeared olive oil on their hands. Today, they open a tube of hand
cream. Below is the list of ingredients of a simple modern hand cream that I
bought at a local store:
deionised water, stearic acid, glycerin, caprylic/caprictiglyceride, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, panax
ginseng root extract, fragrance, cetyl alcohol, triethanolamine, dimeticone, arctostaphylos uva-ursi leaf extract,
magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, imidazolidinyl urea, methyl paraben, camphor, propyl paraben, hydroxyisohexyl
3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, hydroxyl-citronellal, linalool, butylphenyl methylproplonal, citronnellol, limonene,
geraniol.
Almost all of these ingredients were invented or discovered in the last two
centuries.
During World War One, Germany was placed under blockade and suʃered
severe shortages of raw materials, in particular saltpetre, an essential ingredient
in gunpowder and other explosives. The most important saltpetre deposits were in
Chile and India; there were none at all in Germany. True, saltpetre could be
replaced by ammonia, but that was expensive to produce as well. Luckily for the
Germans, one of their fellow citizens, a Jewish chemist named Fritz Haber, had
discovered in 1908 a process for producing ammonia literally out of thin air.
When war broke out, the Germans used Haber’s discovery to commence industrial
production of explosives using air as a raw material. Some scholars believe that if
it hadn’t been for Haber’s discovery, Germany would have been forced to
surrender long before November 1918.6 The discovery won Haber (who during the
war also pioneered the use of poison gas in battle) a Nobel Prize in 1918. In
chemistry, not in peace.

Life on the Conveyor Belt

The Industrial Revolution yielded an unprecedented combination of cheap and
abundant energy and cheap and abundant raw materials. The result was an
explosion in human productivity. The explosion was felt ɹrst and foremost in
agriculture. Usually, when we think of the Industrial Revolution, we think of an
urban landscape of smoking chimneys, or the plight of exploited coal miners
sweating in the bowels of the earth. Yet the Industrial Revolution was above all
else the Second Agricultural Revolution.
During the last 200 years, industrial production methods became the mainstay
of agriculture. Machines such as tractors began to undertake tasks that were
previously performed by muscle power, or not performed at all. Fields and
animals became vastly more productive thanks to artiɹcial fertilisers, industrial
insecticides and an entire arsenal of hormones and medications. Refrigerators,
ships and aeroplanes have made it possible to store produce for months, and
transport it quickly and cheaply to the other side of the world. Europeans began
to dine on fresh Argentinian beef and Japanese sushi.
Even plants and animals were mechanised. Around the time that Homo sapiens
was elevated to divine status by humanist religions, farm animals stopped being
viewed as living creatures that could feel pain and distress, and instead came to

be treated as machines. Today these animals are often mass-produced in factory-
like facilities, their bodies shaped in accordance with industrial needs. They pass

their entire lives as cogs in a giant production line, and the length and quality of
their existence is determined by the proɹts and losses of business corporations.
Even when the industry takes care to keep them alive, reasonably healthy and
well fed, it has no intrinsic interest in the animals’ social and psychological needs
(except when these have a direct impact on production).
Egg-laying hens, for example, have a complex world of behavioural needs and
drives. They feel strong urges to scout their environment, forage and peck around,
determine social hierarchies, build nests and groom themselves. But the egg
industry often locks the hens inside tiny coops, and it is not uncommon for it to
squeeze four hens to a cage, each given a ɻoor space of about twenty-ɹve by
twenty-two centimetres. The hens receive suɽcient food, but they are unable to
claim a territory, build a nest or engage in other natural activities. Indeed, the
cage is so small that hens are often unable even to ɻap their wings or stand fully
erect.
Pigs are among the most intelligent and inquisitive of mammals, second
perhaps only to the great apes. Yet industrialised pig farms routinely conɹne
nursing sows inside such small crates that they are literally unable to turn around
(not to mention walk or forage). The sows are kept in these crates day and night
for four weeks after giving birth. Their oʃspring are then taken away to be
fattened up and the sows are impregnated with the next litter of piglets.

Many dairy cows live almost all their allotted years inside a small enclosure;
standing, sitting and sleeping in their own urine and excrement. They receive
their measure of food, hormones and medications from one set of machines, and
get milked every few hours by another set of machines. The cow in the middle is
treated as little more than a mouth that takes in raw materials and an udder that
produces a commodity. Treating living creatures possessing complex emotional
worlds as if they were machines is likely to cause them not only physical
discomfort, but also much social stress and psychological frustration.7

40. Chicks on a conveyor belt in a commercial hatchery. Male chicks and imperfect female chicks are
picked off the conveyor belt and are then asphyxiated in gas chambers, dropped into automatic
shredders, or simply thrown into the rubbish, where they are crushed to death. Hundreds of millions of

chicks die each year in such hatcheries.

Just as the Atlantic slave trade did not stem from hatred towards Africans, so
the modern animal industry is not motivated by animosity. Again, it is fuelled by
indiʃerence. Most people who produce and consume eggs, milk and meat rarely
stop to think about the fate of the chickens, cows or pigs whose ɻesh and
emissions they are eating. Those who do think often argue that such animals are
really little diʃerent from machines, devoid of sensations and emotions, incapable
of suʃering. Ironically, the same scientiɹc disciplines which shape our milk
machines and egg machines have lately demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
that mammals and birds have a complex sensory and emotional make-up. They
not only feel physical pain, but can also suffer from emotional distress.
Evolutionary psychology maintains that the emotional and social needs of farm

animals evolved in the wild, when they were essential for survival and
reproduction. For example, a wild cow had to know how to form close relations
with other cows and bulls, or else she could not survive and reproduce. In order to
learn the necessary skills, evolution implanted in calves – as in the young of all
other social mammals – a strong desire to play (playing is the mammalian way of
learning social behaviour). And it implanted in them an even stronger desire to
bond with their mothers, whose milk and care were essential for survival.
What happens if farmers now take a young calf, separate her from her mother,
put her in a closed cage, give her food, water and inoculations against diseases,
and then, when she is old enough, inseminate her with bull sperm? From an
objective perspective, this calf no longer needs either maternal bonding or
playmates in order to survive and reproduce. But from a subjective perspective,
the calf still feels a very strong urge to bond with her mother and to play with
other calves. If these urges are not fulɹlled, the calf suʃers greatly. This is the
basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be
felt subjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and
reproduction. The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great care of the
objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective needs.
The truth of this theory has been known at least since the 1950s, when the
American psychologist Harry Harlow studied the development of monkeys.
Harlow separated infant monkeys from their mothers several hours after birth.
The monkeys were isolated inside cages, and then raised by dummy mothers. In
each cage, Harlow placed two dummy mothers. One was made of metal wires, and
was ɹtted with a milk bottle from which the infant monkey could suck. The other
was made of wood covered with cloth, which made it resemble a real monkey
mother, but it provided the infant monkey with no material sustenance
whatsoever. It was assumed that the infants would cling to the nourishing metal
mother rather than to the barren cloth one.
To Harlow’s surprise, the infant monkeys showed a marked preference for the
cloth mother, spending most of their time with her. When the two mothers were
placed in close proximity, the infants held on to the cloth mother even while they
reached over to suck milk from the metal mother. Harlow suspected that perhaps
the infants did so because they were cold. So he ɹtted an electric bulb inside the
wire mother, which now radiated heat. Most of the monkeys, except for the very
young ones, continued to prefer the cloth mother.

41. One of Harlow’s orphaned monkeys clings to the cloth mother even while sucking milk from the

metal mother.

Follow-up research showed that Harlow’s orphaned monkeys grew up to be
emotionally disturbed even though they had received all the nourishment they
required. They never ɹtted into monkey society, had diɽculties communicating
with other monkeys, and suʃered from high levels of anxiety and aggression. The
conclusion was inescapable: monkeys must have psychological needs and desires
that go beyond their material requirements, and if these are not fulɹlled, they will
suʃer greatly. Harlow’s infant monkeys preferred to spend their time in the hands
of the barren cloth mother because they were looking for an emotional bond and
not only for milk. In the following decades, numerous studies showed that this
conclusion applies not only to monkeys, but to other mammals, as well as birds.
At present, millions of farm animals are subjected to the same conditions as
Harlow’s monkeys, as farmers routinely separate calves, kids and other youngsters
from their mothers, to be raised in isolation.8

Altogether, tens of billions of farm animals live today as part of a mechanised
assembly line, and about 50 billion of them are slaughtered annually. These
industrial livestock methods have led to a sharp increase in agricultural
production and in human food reserves. Together with the mechanisation of plant

cultivation, industrial animal husbandry is the basis for the entire modern socio-
economic order. Before the industrialisation of agriculture, most of the food

produced in fields and farms was ‘wasted’ feeding peasants and farmyard animals.
Only a small percentage was available to feed artisans, teachers, priests and
bureaucrats. Consequently, in almost all societies peasants comprised more than
90 per cent of the population. Following the industrialisation of agriculture, a
shrinking number of farmers was enough to feed a growing number of clerks and
factory hands. Today in the United States, only 2 per cent of the population
makes a living from agriculture, yet this 2 per cent produces enough not only to
feed the entire US population, but also to export surpluses to the rest of the
world.9 Without the industrialisation of agriculture the urban Industrial Revolution
could never have taken place – there would not have been enough hands and
brains to staff factories and offices.
As those factories and oɽces absorbed the billions of hands and brains that
were released from ɹeldwork, they began pouring out an unprecedented
avalanche of products. Humans now produce far more steel, manufacture much
more clothing, and build many more structures than ever before. In addition, they
produce a mind-boggling array of previously unimaginable goods, such as light
bulbs, mobile phones, cameras and dishwashers. For the ɹrst time in human
history, supply began to outstrip demand. And an entirely new problem was born:
who is going to buy all this stuff?

The Age of Shopping

The modern capitalist economy must constantly increase production if it is to
survive, like a shark that must swim or suʃocate. Yet it’s not enough just to
produce. Somebody must also buy the products, or industrialists and investors
alike will go bust. To prevent this catastrophe and to make sure that people will
always buy whatever new stuʃ industry produces, a new kind of ethic appeared:
consumerism.
Most people throughout history lived under conditions of scarcity. Frugality was
thus their watchword. The austere ethics of the Puritans and Spartans are but two
famous examples. A good person avoided luxuries, never threw food away, and
patched up torn trousers instead of buying a new pair. Only kings and nobles

allowed themselves to renounce such values publicly and conspicuously ɻaunt
their riches.
Consumerism sees the consumption of ever more products and services as a
positive thing. It encourages people to treat themselves, spoil themselves, and
even kill themselves slowly by overconsumption. Frugality is a disease to be cured.
You don’t have to look far to see the consumer ethic in action – just read the back
of a cereal box. Here’s a quote from a box of one of my favourite breakfast
cereals, produced by an Israeli firm, Telma:
Sometimes you need a treat. Sometimes you need a little extra energy. There are times to watch your weight and
times when you’ve just got to have something ... right now! Telma oʃers a variety of tasty cereals just for you –
treats without remorse.
The same package sports an ad for another brand of cereal called Health Treats:
Health Treats offers lots of grains, fruits and nuts for an experience that combines taste, pleasure and health. For an
enjoyable treat in the middle of the day, suitable for a healthy lifestyle. A real treat with the wonderful taste of
more [emphasis in the original].
Throughout most of history, people were likely to be have been repelled rather
than attracted by such a text. They would have branded it as selɹsh, decadent and
morally corrupt. Consumerism has worked very hard, with the help of popular
psychology (‘Just do it!’) to convince people that indulgence is good for you,
whereas frugality is self-oppression.
It has succeeded. We are all good consumers. We buy countless products that we
don’t really need, and that until yesterday we didn’t know existed. Manufacturers
deliberately design short-term goods and invent new and unnecessary models of
perfectly satisfactory products that we must purchase in order to stay ‘in’.
Shopping has become a favourite pastime, and consumer goods have become
essential mediators in relationships between family members, spouses and friends.
Religious holidays such as Christmas have become shopping festivals. In the
United States, even Memorial Day – originally a solemn day for remembering
fallen soldiers – is now an occasion for special sales. Most people mark this day by
going shopping, perhaps to prove that the defenders of freedom did not die in
vain.
The ɻowering of the consumerist ethic is manifested most clearly in the food
market. Traditional agricultural societies lived in the awful shade of starvation. In
the aʀuent world of today one of the leading health problems is obesity, which
strikes the poor (who stuʃ themselves with hamburgers and pizzas) even more
severely than the rich (who eat organic salads and fruit smoothies). Each year the
US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all

the hungry people in the rest of the world. Obesity is a double victory for
consumerism. Instead of eating little, which will lead to economic contraction,
people eat too much and then buy diet products – contributing to economic
growth twice over.

How can we square the consumerist ethic with the capitalist ethic of the business
person, according to which proɹts should not be wasted, and should instead be
reinvested in production? It’s simple. As in previous eras, there is today a division
of labour between the elite and the masses. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent
their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally,
minding every penny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care
managing their assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt
buying cars and televisions they don’t really need.
The capitalist and consumerist ethics are two sides of the same coin, a merger of
two commandments. The supreme commandment of the rich is ‘Invest!’ The
supreme commandment of the rest of us is ‘Buy!’
The capitalist-consumerist ethic is revolutionary in another respect. Most
previous ethical systems presented people with a pretty tough deal. They were
promised paradise, but only if they cultivated compassion and tolerance,
overcame craving and anger, and restrained their selɹsh interests. This was too
tough for most. The history of ethics is a sad tale of wonderful ideals that nobody
can live up to. Most Christians did not imitate Christ, most Buddhists failed to
follow Buddha, and most Confucians would have caused Confucius a temper
tantrum.
In contrast, most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist
ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy
and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to
their cravings and passions – and buy more and more. This is the ɹrst religion in
history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do
we know that we’ll really get paradise in return? We’ve seen it on television.

A Permanent Revolution

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OPENED up new ways to convert energy and to
produce goods, largely liberating humankind from its dependence on the
surrounding ecosystem. Humans cut down forests, drained swamps, dammed
rivers, ɻooded plains, laid down tens of thousands of kilometres of railroad tracks,
and built skyscraping metropolises. As the world was moulded to ɹt the needs of
Homo sapiens, habitats were destroyed and species went extinct. Our once green
and blue planet is becoming a concrete and plastic shopping centre.
Today, the earths continents are home to almost 7 billion Sapiens. If you took
all these people and put them on a large set of scales, their combined mass would
be about 300 million tons. If you then took all our domesticated farmyard animals
– cows, pigs, sheep and chickens – and placed them on an even larger set of
scales, their mass would amount to about 700 million tons. In contrast, the
combined mass of all surviving large wild animals – from porcupines and
penguins to elephants and whales – is less than 100 million tons. Our children’s
books, our iconography and our TV screens are still full of giraʃes, wolves and
chimpanzees, but the real world has very few of them left. There are about 80,000
giraʃes in the world, compared to 1.5 billion cattle; only 200,000 wolves,
compared to 400 million domesticated dogs; only 250,000 chimpanzees – in
contrast to billions of humans. Humankind really has taken over the world.1
Ecological degradation is not the same as resource scarcity. As we saw in the
previous chapter, the resources available to humankind are constantly increasing,
and are likely to continue to do so. That’s why doomsday prophesies of resource
scarcity are probably misplaced. In contrast, the fear of ecological degradation is
only too well founded. The future may see Sapiens gaining control of a cornucopia
of new materials and energy sources, while simultaneously destroying what
remains of the natural habitat and driving most other species to extinction.
In fact, ecological turmoil might endanger the survival of Homo sapiens itself.
Global warming, rising oceans and widespread pollution could make the earth less
hospitable to our kind, and the future might consequently see a spiralling race
between human power and human-induced natural disasters. As humans use their
power to counter the forces of nature and subjugate the ecosystem to their needs

and whims, they might cause more and more unanticipated and dangerous side
eʃects. These are likely to be controllable only by even more drastic
manipulations of the ecosystem, which would result in even worse chaos.
Many call this process ‘the destruction of nature’. But it’s not really destruction,
it’s change. Nature cannot be destroyed. Sixty-ɹve million years ago, an asteroid
wiped out the dinosaurs, but in so doing opened the way forward for mammals.
Today, humankind is driving many species into extinction and might even
annihilate itself. But other organisms are doing quite well. Rats and cockroaches,
for example, are in their heyday. These tenacious creatures would probably creep
out from beneath the smoking rubble of a nuclear Armageddon, ready and able to
spread their DNA. Perhaps 65 million years from now, intelligent rats will look
back gratefully on the decimation wrought by humankind, just as we today can
thank that dinosaur-busting asteroid.
Still, the rumours of our own extinction are premature. Since the Industrial
Revolution, the world’s human population has burgeoned as never before. In 1700
the world was home to some 700 million humans. In 1800 there were 950 million
of us. By 1900 we almost doubled our numbers to 1.6 billion. And by 2000 that
quadrupled to 6 billion. Today there are just shy of 7 billion Sapiens.

Modern Time

While all these Sapiens have grown increasingly impervious to the whims of
nature, they have become ever more subject to the dictates of modern industry
and government. The Industrial Revolution opened the way to a long line of
experiments in social engineering and an even longer series of unpremeditated
changes in daily life and human mentality. One example among many is the
replacement of the rhythms of traditional agriculture with the uniform and precise
schedule of industry.
Traditional agriculture depended on cycles of natural time and organic growth.
Most societies were unable to make precise time measurements, nor were they
terribly interested in doing so. The world went about its business without clocks
and timetables, subject only to the movements of the sun and the growth cycles of
plants. There was no uniform working day, and all routines changed drastically
from season to season. People knew where the sun was, and watched anxiously
for portents of the rainy season and harvest time, but they did not know the hour
and hardly cared about the year. If a lost time traveller popped up in a medieval
village and asked a passerby, ‘What year is this?’ the villager would be as
bewildered by the question as by the strangers ridiculous clothing.

In contrast to medieval peasants and shoemakers, modern industry cares little
about the sun or the season. It sanctiɹes precision and uniformity. For example, in
a medieval workshop each shoemaker made an entire shoe, from sole to buckle. If
one shoemaker was late for work, it did not stall the others. However, in a
modern footwear-factory assembly line, every worker mans a machine that
produces just a small part of a shoe, which is then passed on to the next machine.
If the worker who operates machine no. 5 has overslept, it stalls all the other
machines. In order to prevent such calamities, everybody must adhere to a precise
timetable. Each worker arrives at work at exactly the same time. Everybody takes
their lunch break together, whether they are hungry or not. Everybody goes home
when a whistle announces that the shift is over – not when they have ɹnished
their project.

42. Charlie Chaplin as a simple worker caught in the wheels of the industrial assembly line, from the film

Modern Times (1936).

The Industrial Revolution turned the timetable and the assembly line into a
template for almost all human activities. Shortly after factories imposed their time
frames on human behaviour, schools too adopted precise timetables, followed by
hospitals, government oɽces and grocery stores. Even in places devoid of
assembly lines and machines, the timetable became king. If the shift at the factory
ends at 5 p.m., the local pub had better be open for business by 5:02.
A crucial link in the spreading timetable system was public transportation. If
workers needed to start their shift by 08:00, the train or bus had to reach the
factory gate by 07:55. A few minutes’ delay would lower production and perhaps

even lead to the lay-oʃs of the unfortunate latecomers. In 1784 a carriage service
with a published schedule began operating in Britain. Its timetable speciɹed only
the hour of departure, not arrival. Back then, each British city and town had its
own local time, which could diʃer from London time by up to half an hour. When
it was 12:00 in London, it was perhaps 12:20 in Liverpool and 11:50 in
Canterbury. Since there were no telephones, no radio or television, and no fast
trains – who could know, and who cared?2
The ɹrst commercial train service began operating between Liverpool and
Manchester in 1830. Ten years later, the ɹrst train timetable was issued. The
trains were much faster than the old carriages, so the quirky diʃerences in local
hours became a severe nuisance. In 1847, British train companies put their heads
together and agreed that henceforth all train timetables would be calibrated to
Greenwich Observatory time, rather than the local times of Liverpool, Manchester
or Glasgow. More and more institutions followed the lead of the train companies.
Finally, in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of legislating
that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the first time in history, a
country adopted a national time and obliged its population to live according to an
artificial clock rather than local ones or sunrise-to-sunset cycles.
This modest beginning spawned a global network of timetables, synchronised
down to the tiniest fractions of a second. When the broadcast media – ɹrst radio,
then television – made their debut, they entered a world of timetables and became
its main enforcers and evangelists. Among the ɹrst things radio stations broadcast
were time signals, beeps that enabled far-ɻung settlements and ships at sea to set
their clocks. Later, radio stations adopted the custom of broadcasting the news
every hour. Nowadays, the ɹrst item of every news broadcast – more important
even than the outbreak of war – is the time. During World War Two, BBC News
was broadcast to Nazi-occupied Europe. Each news programme opened with a live
broadcast of Big Ben tolling the hour – the magical sound of freedom. Ingenious
German physicists found a way to determine the weather conditions in London
based on tiny differences in the tone of the broadcast ding-dongs. This information
oʃered invaluable help to the Luftwaʃe. When the British Secret Service
discovered this, they replaced the live broadcast with a set recording of the famous
clock.
In order to run the timetable network, cheap but precise portable clocks became
ubiquitous. In Assyrian, Sassanid or Inca cities there might have been at most a
few sundials. In European medieval cities there was usually a single clock – a
giant machine mounted on top of a high tower in the town square. These tower
clocks were notoriously inaccurate, but since there were no other clocks in town to
contradict them, it hardly made any diʃerence. Today, a single aʀuent family
generally has more timepieces at home than an entire medieval country. You can

tell the time by looking at your wristwatch, glancing at your Android, peering at
the alarm clock by your bed, gazing at the clock on the kitchen wall, staring at the
microwave, catching a glimpse of the TV or DVD, or taking in the taskbar on your
computer out of the corner of your eye. You need to make a conscious eʃort not to
know what time it is.
The typical person consults these clocks several dozen times a day, because
almost everything we do has to be done on time. An alarm clock wakes us up at 7
a.m., we heat our frozen bagel for exactly ɹfty seconds in the microwave, brush
our teeth for three minutes until the electric toothbrush beeps, catch the 07:40
train to work, run on the treadmill at the gym until the beeper announces that
half an hour is over, sit down in front of the TV at 7 p.m. to watch our favourite
show, get interrupted at preordained moments by commercials that cost $1,000
per second, and eventually unload all our angst on a therapist who restricts our
prattle to the now standard fifty-minute therapy hour.

The Industrial Revolution brought about dozens of major upheavals in human
society. Adapting to industrial time is just one of them. Other notable examples
include urbanisation, the disappearance of the peasantry, the rise of the industrial
proletariat, the empowerment of the common person, democratisation, youth
culture and the disintegration of patriarchy.
Yet all of these upheavals are dwarfed by the most momentous social revolution
that ever befell humankind: the collapse of the family and the local community
and their replacement by the state and the market. As best we can tell, from the
earliest times, more than a million years ago, humans lived in small, intimate
communities, most of whose members were kin. The Cognitive Revolution and the
Agricultural Revolution did not change that. They glued together families and
communities to create tribes, cities, kingdoms and empires, but families and
communities remained the basic building blocks of all human societies. The
Industrial Revolution, on the other hand, managed within little more than two
centuries to break these building blocks into atoms. Most of the traditional
functions of families and communities were handed over to states and markets.

The Collapse of the Family and the Community

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the daily life of most humans ran its course
within three ancient frames: the nuclear family, the extended family and the local
intimate community.* Most people worked in the family business – the family
farm or the family workshop, for example – or they worked in their neighbours’

family businesses. The family was also the welfare system, the health system, the
education system, the construction industry, the trade union, the pension fund, the
insurance company, the radio, the television, the newspapers, the bank and even
the police.
When a person fell sick, the family took care of her. When a person grew old,
the family supported her, and her children were her pension fund. When a person
died, the family took care of the orphans. If a person wanted to build a hut, the
family lent a hand. If a person wanted to open a business, the family raised the
necessary money. If a person wanted to marry, the family chose, or at least
vetted, the prospective spouse. If conɻict arose with a neighbour, the family
muscled in. But if a person’s illness was too grave for the family to manage, or a
new business demanded too large an investment, or the neighbourhood quarrel
escalated to the point of violence, the local community came to the rescue.
The community oʃered help on the basis of local traditions and an economy of
favours, which often diʃered greatly from the supply and demand laws of the free
market. In an old-fashioned medieval community, when my neighbour was in
need, I helped build his hut and guard his sheep, without expecting any payment
in return. When I was in need, my neighbour returned the favour. At the same
time, the local potentate might have drafted all of us villagers to construct his
castle without paying us a penny. In exchange, we counted on him to defend us
against brigands and barbarians. Village life involved many transactions but few
payments. There were some markets, of course, but their roles were limited. You
could buy rare spices, cloth and tools, and hire the services of lawyers and doctors.
Yet less than 10 per cent of commonly used products and services were bought in
the market. Most human needs were taken care of by the family and the
community.
There were also kingdoms and empires that performed important tasks such as
waging wars, building roads and constructing palaces. For these purposes kings
raised taxes and occasionally enlisted soldiers and labourers. Yet, with few
exceptions, they tended to stay out of the daily aʃairs of families and
communities. Even if they wanted to intervene, most kings could do so only with
diɽculty. Traditional agricultural economies had few surpluses with which to feed
crowds of government oɽcials, policemen, social workers, teachers and doctors.
Consequently, most rulers did not develop mass welfare systems, health-care
systems or educational systems. They left such matters in the hands of families and
communities. Even on rare occasions when rulers tried to intervene more
intensively in the daily lives of the peasantry (as happened, for example, in the
Qin Empire in China), they did so by converting family heads and community
elders into government agents.
Often enough, transportation and communication diɽculties made it so diɽcult

to intervene in the aʃairs of remote communities that many kingdoms preferred
to cede even the most basic royal prerogatives – such as taxation and violence – to
communities. The Ottoman Empire, for instance, allowed family vendettas to mete
out justice, rather than supporting a large imperial police force. If my cousin
killed somebody, the victim’s brother might kill me in sanctioned revenge. The
sultan in Istanbul or even the provincial pasha did not intervene in such clashes,
as long as violence remained within acceptable limits.
In the Chinese Ming Empire (1368–1644), the population was organised into
the baojia system. Ten families were grouped to form a jia, and ten jia constituted a
bao. When a member of a bao commited a crime, other bao members could be
punished for it, in particular the bao elders. Taxes too were levied on the bao, and
it was the responsibility of the bao elders rather than of the state oɽcials to assess
the situation of each family and determine the amount of tax it should pay. From
the empire’s perspective, this system had a huge advantage. Instead of
maintaining thousands of revenue oɽcials and tax collectors, who would have to
monitor the earnings and expenses of every family, these tasks were left to the
community elders. The elders knew how much each villager was worth and they
could usually enforce tax payments without involving the imperial army.
Many kingdoms and empires were in truth little more than large protection
rackets. The king was the capo di tutti capi who collected protection money, and in
return made sure that neighbouring crime syndicates and local small fry did not
harm those under his protection. He did little else.
Life in the bosom of family and community was far from ideal. Families and
communities could oppress their members no less brutally than do modern states
and markets, and their internal dynamics were often fraught with tension and
violence – yet people had little choice. A person who lost her family and
community around 1750 was as good as dead. She had no job, no education and
no support in times of sickness and distress. Nobody would loan her money or
defend her if she got into trouble. There were no policemen, no social workers and
no compulsory education. In order to survive, such a person quickly had to ɹnd an
alternative family or community. Boys and girls who ran away from home could
expect, at best, to become servants in some new family. At worst, there was the
army or the brothel.

All this changed dramatically over the last two centuries. The Industrial
Revolution gave the market immense new powers, provided the state with new
means of communication and transportation, and placed at the government’s
disposal an army of clerks, teachers, policemen and social workers. At ɹrst the
market and the state discovered their path blocked by traditional families and
communities who had little love for outside intervention. Parents and community

elders were reluctant to let the younger generation be indoctrinated by nationalist
education systems, conscripted into armies or turned into a rootless urban
proletariat.
Over time, states and markets used their growing power to weaken the
traditional bonds of family and community. The state sent its policemen to stop
family vendettas and replace them with court decisions. The market sent its

hawkers to wipe out longstanding local traditions and replace them with ever-
changing commercial fashions. Yet this was not enough. In order really to break

the power of family and community, they needed the help of a fifth column.
The state and the market approached people with an oʃer that could not be
refused. ‘Become individuals,’ they said. ‘Marry whomever you desire, without
asking permission from your parents. Take up whatever job suits you, even if
community elders frown. Live wherever you wish, even if you cannot make it
every week to the family dinner. You are no longer dependent on your family or
your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. We
will provide food, shelter, education, health, welfare and employment. We will
provide pensions, insurance and protection.’
Romantic literature often presents the individual as somebody caught in a
struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the
individual can survive only thanks to them. The market provides us with work,
insurance and a pension. If we want to study a profession, the government’s
schools are there to teach us. If we want to open a business, the bank loans us
money. If we want to build a house, a construction company builds it and the
bank gives us a mortgage, in some cases subsidised or insured by the state. If
violence ɻares up, the police protect us. If we are sick for a few days, our health
insurance takes care of us. If we are debilitated for months, social security steps
in. If we need around-the-clock assistance, we can go to the market and hire a
nurse – usually some stranger from the other side of the world who takes care of
us with the kind of devotion that we no longer expect from our own children. If
we have the means, we can spend our golden years at a senior citizens’ home. The
tax authorities treat us as individuals, and do not expect us to pay the neighbours’
taxes. The courts, too, see us as individuals, and never punish us for the crimes of
our cousins.
Not only adult men, but also women and children, are recognised as individuals.
Throughout most of history, women were often seen as the property of family or
community. Modern states, on the other hand, see women as individuals, enjoying
economic and legal rights independently of their family and community. They
may hold their own bank accounts, decide whom to marry, and even choose to
divorce or live on their own.

But the liberation of the individual comes at a cost. Many of us now bewail the
loss of strong families and communities and feel alienated and threatened by the
power the impersonal state and market wield over our lives. States and markets
composed of alienated individuals can intervene in the lives of their members
much more easily than states and markets composed of strong families and
communities. When neighbours in a high-rise apartment building cannot even
agree on how much to pay their janitor, how can we expect them to resist the
state?
The deal between states, markets and individuals is an uneasy one. The state
and the market disagree about their mutual rights and obligations, and individuals
complain that both demand too much and provide too little. In many cases
individuals are exploited by markets, and states employ their armies, police forces
and bureaucracies to persecute individuals instead of defending them. Yet it is
amazing that this deal works at all – however imperfectly. For it breaches
countless generations of human social arrangements. Millions of years of
evolution have designed us to live and think as community members. Within a
mere two centuries we have become alienated individuals. Nothing testiɹes better
to the awesome power of culture.

The nuclear family did not disappear completely from the modern landscape.
When states and markets took from the family most of its economic and political
roles, they left it some important emotional functions. The modern family is still
supposed to provide for intimate needs, which state and market are (so far)
incapable of providing. Yet even here the family is subject to increasing
interventions. The market shapes to an ever-greater degree the way people
conduct their romantic and sexual lives. Whereas traditionally the family was the
main matchmaker, today it’s the market that tailors our romantic and sexual
preferences, and then lends a hand in providing for them – for a fat fee.
Previously bride and groom met in the family living room, and money passed
from the hands of one father to another. Today courting is done at bars and cafés,
and money passes from the hands of lovers to waitresses. Even more money is
transferred to the bank accounts of fashion designers, gym managers, dieticians,
cosmeticians and plastic surgeons, who help us arrive at the café looking as
similar as possible to the markets ideal of beauty.

Family and community vs. state and market

The state, too, keeps a sharper eye on family relations, especially between
parents and children. Parents are obliged to send their children to be educated by
the state. Parents who are especially abusive or violent with their children may be
restrained by the state. If need be, the state may even imprison the parents or
transfer their children to foster families. Until not long ago, the suggestion that
the state ought to prevent parents from beating or humiliating their children
would have been rejected out of hand as ludicrous and unworkable. In most
societies parental authority was sacred. Respect of and obedience to one’s parents
were among the most hallowed values, and parents could do almost anything they
wanted, including killing newborn babies, selling children into slavery and
marrying oʃ daughters to men more than twice their age. Today, parental
authority is in full retreat. Youngsters are increasingly excused from obeying their
elders, whereas parents are blamed for anything that goes wrong in the life of
their child. Mum and Dad are about as likely to get oʃ in the Freudian courtroom
as were defendants in a Stalinist show trial.

Imagined Communities

Like the nuclear family, the community could not completely disappear from our
world without any emotional replacement. Markets and states today provide most
of the material needs once provided by communities, but they must also supply
tribal bonds.
Markets and states do so by fostering ‘imagined communities’ that contain
millions of strangers, and which are tailored to national and commercial needs.

An imagined community is a community of people who don’t really know each
other, but imagine that they do. Such communities are not a novel invention.
Kingdoms, empires and churches functioned for millennia as imagined
communities. In ancient China, tens of millions of people saw themselves as
members of a single family, with the emperor as its father. In the Middle Ages,
millions of devout Muslims imagined that they were all brothers and sisters in the
great community of Islam. Yet throughout history, such imagined communities
played second ɹddle to intimate communities of several dozen people who knew
each other well. The intimate communities fulɹlled the emotional needs of their
members and were essential for everyone’s survival and welfare. In the last two
centuries, the intimate communities have withered, leaving imagined communities
to fill in the emotional vacuum.
The two most important examples for the rise of such imagined communities are
the nation and the consumer tribe. The nation is the imagined community of the
state. The consumer tribe is the imagined community of the market. Both are
imagined communities because it is impossible for all customers in a market or for
all members of a nation really to know one another the way villagers knew one
another in the past. No German can intimately know the other 80 million
members of the German nation, or the other 500 million customers inhabiting the
European Common Market (which evolved ɹrst into the European Community
and finally became the European Union).
Consumerism and nationalism work extra hours to make us imagine that
millions of strangers belong to the same community as ourselves, that we all have
a common past, common interests and a common future. This isn’t a lie. It’s
imagination. Like money, limited liability companies and human rights, nations
and consumer tribes are inter-subjective realities. They exist only in our collective
imagination, yet their power is immense. As long as millions of Germans believe
in the existence of a German nation, get excited at the sight of German national
symbols, retell German national myths, and are willing to sacriɹce money, time
and limbs for the German nation, Germany will remain one of the strongest
powers in the world.
The nation does its best to hide its imagined character. Most nations argue that
they are a natural and eternal entity, created in some primordial epoch by mixing
the soil of the motherland with the blood of the people. Yet such claims are usually
exaggerated. Nations existed in the distant past, but their importance was much
smaller than today because the importance of the state was much smaller. A
resident of medieval Nuremberg might have felt some loyalty towards the German
nation, but she felt far more loyalty towards her family and local community,
which took care of most of her needs. Moreover, whatever importance ancient
nations may have had, few of them survived. Most existing nations evolved only

after the Industrial Revolution.
The Middle East provides ample examples. The Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and
Iraqi nations are the product of haphazard borders drawn in the sand by French
and British diplomats who ignored local history, geography and economy. These
diplomats determined in 1918 that the people of Kurdistan, Baghdad and Basra
would henceforth be ‘Iraqis’. It was primarily the French who decided who would
be Syrian and who Lebanese. Saddam Hussein and Hafez el-Asad tried their best to
promote and reinforce their Anglo-French-manufactured national consciousnesses,
but their bombastic speeches about the allegedly eternal Iraqi and Syrian nations
had a hollow ring.
It goes without saying that nations cannot be created from thin air. Those who
worked hard to construct Iraq or Syria made use of real historical, geographical
and cultural raw materials – some of which are centuries and millennia old.
Saddam Hussein co-opted the heritage of the Abbasid caliphate and the
Babylonian Empire, even calling one of his crack armoured units the Hammurabi
Division. Yet that does not turn the Iraqi nation into an ancient entity. If I bake a
cake from ɻour, oil and sugar, all of which have been sitting in my pantry for the
past two months, it does not mean that the cake itself is two months old.
In recent decades, national communities have been increasingly eclipsed by
tribes of customers who do not know one another intimately but share the same
consumption habits and interests, and therefore feel part of the same consumer
tribe – and deɹne themselves as such. This sounds very strange, but we are
surrounded by examples. Madonna fans, for example, constitute a consumer tribe.
They deɹne themselves largely by shopping. They buy Madonna concert tickets,
CDs, posters, shirts and ring tones, and thereby deɹne who they are. Manchester
United fans, vegetarians and environmentalists are other examples. They, too, are
deɹned above all by what they consume. It is the keystone of their identity. A
German vegetarian might well prefer to marry a French vegetarian than a
German carnivore.

Perpetuum Mobile

The revolutions of the last two centuries have been so swift and radical that they
have changed the most fundamental characteristic of the social order.
Traditionally, the social order was hard and rigid. ‘Order’ implied stability and
continuity. Swift social revolutions were exceptional, and most social
transformations resulted from the accumulation of numerous small steps. Humans
tended to assume that the social structure was inɻexible and eternal. Families and

communities might struggle to change their place within the order, but the idea
that you could change the fundamental structure of the order was alien. People
tended to reconcile themselves to the status quo, declaring that ‘this is how it
always was, and this is how it always will be’.
Over the last two centuries, the pace of change became so quick that the social
order acquired a dynamic and malleable nature. It now exists in a state of
permanent ɻux. When we speak of modern revolutions we tend to think of 1789
(the French Revolution), 1848 (the liberal revolutions) or 1917 (the Russian
Revolution). But the fact is that, these days, every year is revolutionary. Today,
even a thirty-year-old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers, ‘When I was young,
the world was completely diʃerent.’ The Internet, for example, came into wide
usage only in the early 1990s, hardly twenty years ago. Today we cannot imagine
the world without it.
Hence any attempt to deɹne the characteristics of modern society is akin to
deɹning the colour of a chameleon. The only characteristic of which we can be
certain is the incessant change. People have become used to this, and most of us
think about the social order as something ɻexible, which we can engineer and
improve at will. The main promise of premodern rulers was to safeguard the
traditional order or even to go back to some lost golden age. In the last two
centuries, the currency of politics is that it promises to destroy the old world and
build a better one in its place. Not even the most conservative of political parties
vows merely to keep things as they are. Everybody promises social reform,
educational reform, economic reform – and they often fulfil those promises.

Just as geologists expect that tectonic movements will result in earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions, so might we expect that drastic social movements will result in
bloody outbursts of violence. The political history of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries is often told as a series of deadly wars, holocausts and revolutions. Like
a child in new boots leaping from puddle to puddle, this view sees history as
leapfrogging from one bloodbath to the next, from World War One to World War
Two to the Cold War, from the Armenian genocide to the Jewish genocide to the
Rwandan genocide, from Robespierre to Lenin to Hitler.
There is truth here, but this all too familiar list of calamities is somewhat
misleading. We focus too much on the puddles and forget about the dry land
separating them. The late modern era has seen unprecedented levels not only of
violence and horror, but also of peace and tranquillity. Charles Dickens wrote of
the French Revolution that ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ This
may be true not only of the French Revolution, but of the entire era it heralded.
It is especially true of the seven decades that have elapsed since the end of
World War Two. During this period humankind has for the ɹrst time faced the

possibility of complete self-annihilation and has experienced a fair number of
actual wars and genocides. Yet these decades were also the most peaceful era in
human history – and by a wide margin. This is surprising because these very same
decades experienced more economic, social and political change than any
previous era. The tectonic plates of history are moving at a frantic pace, but the
volcanoes are mostly silent. The new elastic order seems to be able to contain and
even initiate radical structural changes without collapsing into violent conflict.3

Peace in Our Time

Most people don’t appreciate just how peaceful an era we live in. None of us was
alive a thousand years ago, so we easily forget how much more violent the world
used to be. And as wars become more rare they attract more attention. Many
more people think about the wars raging today in Afghanistan and Iraq than
about the peace in which most Brazilians and Indians live.
Even more importantly, it’s easier to relate to the suʃering of individuals than
of entire populations. However, in order to understand macro-historical processes,
we need to examine mass statistics rather than individual stories. In the year
2000, wars caused the deaths of 310,000 individuals, and violent crime killed
another 520,000. Each and every victim is a world destroyed, a family ruined,
friends and relatives scarred for life. Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000
victims comprised only 1.5 per cent of the 56 million people who died in 2000.
That year 1.26 million people died in car accidents (2.25 per cent of total
mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent).4
The ɹgures for 2002 are even more surprising. Out of 57 million dead, only
172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a total of 741,000
victims of human violence). In contrast, 873,000 people committed suicide.5 It
turns out that in the year following the 9/11 attacks, despite all the talk of
terrorism and war, the average person was more likely to kill himself than to be
killed by a terrorist, a soldier or a drug dealer.
In most parts of the world, people go to sleep without fearing that in the middle
of the night a neighbouring tribe might surround their village and slaughter
everyone. Well-oʃ British subjects travel daily from Nottingham to London
through Sherwood Forest without fear that a gang of merry green-clad brigands
will ambush them and take their money to give to the poor (or, more likely,
murder them and take the money for themselves). Students brook no canings from
their teachers, children need not fear that they will be sold into slavery when their
parents can’t pay their bills, and women know that the law forbids their husbands

from beating them and forcing them to stay at home. Increasingly, around the
world, these expectations are fulfilled.
The decline of violence is due largely to the rise of the state. Throughout history,
most violence resulted from local feuds between families and communities. (Even
today, as the above ɹgures indicate, local crime is a far deadlier threat than
international wars.) As we have seen, early farmers, who knew no political
organisations larger than the local community, suʃered rampant violence.6 As
kingdoms and empires became stronger, they reined in communities and the level
of violence decreased. In the decentralised kingdoms of medieval Europe, about
twenty to forty people were murdered each year for every 100,000 inhabitants. In
recent decades, when states and markets have become all-powerful and
communities have vanished, violence rates have dropped even further. Today the
global average is only nine murders a year per 100,000 people, and most of these
murders take place in weak states such as Somalia and Colombia. In the
centralised states of Europe, the average is one murder a year per 100,000
people.7
There are certainly cases where states use their power to kill their own citizens,
and these often loom large in our memories and fears. During the twentieth
century, tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people were killed by the
security forces of their own states. Still, from a macro perspective, state-run courts
and police forces have probably increased the level of security worldwide. Even in
oppressive dictatorships, the average modern person is far less likely to die at the
hands of another person than in premodern societies. In 1964 a military
dictatorship was established in Brazil. It ruled the country until 1985. During these
twenty years, several thousand Brazilians were murdered by the regime.
Thousands more were imprisoned and tortured. Yet even in the worst years, the
average Brazilian in Rio de Janeiro was far less likely to die at human hands than
the average Waorani, Arawete or Yanomamo. The Waorani, Arawete and
Yanomamo are indigenous people who live in the depths of the Amazon forest,
without army, police or prisons. Anthropological studies have indicated that
between a quarter and a half of their menfolk die sooner or later in violent
conflicts over property, women or prestige.8

Imperial Retirement

It is perhaps debatable whether violence within states has decreased or increased
since 1945. What nobody can deny is that international violence has dropped to
an all-time low. Perhaps the most obvious example is the collapse of the European

empires. Throughout history empires have crushed rebellions with an iron ɹst, and
when its day came, a sinking empire used all its might to save itself, usually
collapsing into a bloodbath. Its ɹnal demise generally led to anarchy and wars of
succession. Since 1945 most empires have opted for peaceful early retirement.
Their process of collapse became relatively swift, calm and orderly.
In 1945 Britain ruled a quarter of the globe. Thirty years later it ruled just a few
small islands. In the intervening decades it retreated from most of its colonies in a
peaceful and orderly manner. Though in some places such as Malaya and Kenya
the British tried to hang on by force of arms, in most places they accepted the end
of empire with a sigh rather than with a temper tantrum. They focused their
eʃorts not on retaining power, but on transferring it as smoothly as possible. At
least some of the praise usually heaped on Mahatma Gandhi for his non-violent
creed is actually owed to the British Empire. Despite many years of bitter and
often violent struggle, when the end of the Raj came, the Indians did not have to
ɹght the British in the streets of Delhi and Calcutta. The empire’s place was taken
by a slew of independent states, most of which have since enjoyed stable borders
and have for the most part lived peacefully alongside their neighbours. True, tens
of thousands of people perished at the hands of the threatened British Empire, and
in several hot spots its retreat led to the eruption of ethnic conɻicts that claimed
hundreds of thousands of lives (particularly in India). Yet when compared to the
long-term historical average, the British withdrawal was an exemplar of peace
and order. The French Empire was more stubborn. Its collapse involved bloody
rearguard actions in Vietnam and Algeria that cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
Yet the French, too, retreated from the rest of their dominions quickly and
peacefully, leaving behind orderly states rather than a chaotic free-for-all.
The Soviet collapse in 1989 was even more peaceful, despite the eruption of
ethnic conɻict in the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Never before has
such a mighty empire disappeared so swiftly and so quietly. The Soviet Empire of
1989 had suʃered no military defeat except in Afghanistan, no external invasions,
no rebellions, nor even large-scale Martin Luther King-style campaigns of civil
disobedience. The Soviets still had millions of soldiers, tens of thousands of tanks
and aeroplanes, and enough nuclear weapons to wipe out the whole of
humankind several times over. The Red Army and the other Warsaw Pact armies
remained loyal. Had the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev, given the order, the
Red Army would have opened fire on the subjugated masses.
Yet the Soviet elite, and the Communist regimes through most of eastern Europe
(Romania and Serbia were the exceptions), chose not to use even a tiny fraction of
this military power. When its members realised that Communism was bankrupt,
they renounced force, admitted their failure, packed their suitcases and went
home. Gorbachev and his colleagues gave up without a struggle not only the

Soviet conquests of World War Two, but also the much older tsarist conquests in
the Baltic, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is chilling to
contemplate what might have happened if Gorbachev had behaved like the
Serbian leadership – or like the French in Algeria.

Pax Atomica

The independent states that came after these empires were remarkably
uninterested in war. With very few exceptions, since 1945 states no longer invade
other states in order to conquer and swallow them up. Such conquests had been
the bread and butter of political history since time immemorial. It was how most
great empires were established, and how most rulers and populations expected
things to stay. But campaigns of conquest like those of the Romans, Mongols and
Ottomans cannot take place today anywhere in the world. Since 1945, no
independent country recognised by the UN has been conquered and wiped oʃ the
map. Limited international wars still occur from time to time, and millions still die
in wars, but wars are no longer the norm.
Many people believe that the disappearance of international war is unique to
the rich democracies of western Europe. In fact, peace reached Europe after it
prevailed in other parts of the world. Thus the last serious international wars
between South American countries were the Peru-Ecuador War of 1941 and the
Bolivia-Paraguay War of 1932–5. And before that there hadn’t been a serious war
between South American countries since 1879–84, with Chile on one side and
Bolivia and Peru on the other.
We seldom think of the Arab world as particularly peaceful. Yet only once since
the Arab countries won their independence has one of them mounted a full-scale
invasion of another (the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990). There have been quite
a few border clashes (e.g. Syria vs Jordan in 1970), many armed interventions of
one in the aʃairs of another (e.g. Syria in Lebanon), numerous civil wars (Algeria,
Yemen, Libya) and an abundance of coups and revolts. Yet there have been no
full-scale international wars among the Arab states except the Gulf War. Even
widening the scope to include the entire Muslim world adds only one more

example, the Iran-Iraq War. There was no Turkey—Iran War, Pakistan-
Afghanistan War, or Indonesia-Malaysia War.

In Africa things are far less rosy. But even there, most conɻicts are civil wars
and coups. Since African states won their independence in the 1960s and 1970s,
very few countries have invaded one another in the hope of conquest.
There have been periods of relative calm before, as, for example, in Europe

between 1871 and 1914, and they always ended badly. But this time it is diʃerent.
For real peace is not the mere absence of war. Real peace is the implausibility of
war. There has never been real peace in the world. Between 1871 and 1914, a
European war remained a plausible eventuality, and the expectation of war
dominated the thinking of armies, politicians and ordinary citizens alike. This
foreboding was true for all other peaceful periods in history. An iron law of
international politics decreed, ‘For every two nearby polities, there is a plausible
scenario that will cause them to go to war against one another within one year.’
This law of the jungle was in force in late nineteenth-century Europe, in medieval
Europe, in ancient China and in classical Greece. If Sparta and Athens were at
peace in 450 BC, there was a plausible scenario that they would be at war by 449
BC.
Today humankind has broken the law of the jungle. There is at last real peace,
and not just absence of war. For most polities, there is no plausible scenario
leading to full-scale conɻict within one year. What could lead to war between
Germany and France next year? Or between China and Japan? Or between Brazil
and Argentina? Some minor border clash might occur, but only a truly apocalyptic
scenario could result in an old-fashioned full-scale war between Brazil and
Argentina in 2014, with Argentinian armoured divisions sweeping to the gates of
Rio, and Brazilian carpet-bombers pulverising the neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires.
Such wars might still erupt between several pairs of states, e.g. between Israel and
Syria, Ethiopia and Eritrea, or the USA and Iran, but these are only the exceptions
that prove the rule.
This situation might of course change in the future and, with hindsight, the
world of today might seem incredibly naïve. Yet from a historical perspective, our
very naïvety is fascinating. Never before has peace been so prevalent that people
could not even imagine war.

Scholars have sought to explain this happy development in more books and
articles than you would ever want to read yourself, and they have identiɹed
several contributing factors. First and foremost, the price of war has gone up
dramatically. The Nobel Peace Prize to end all peace prizes should have been
given to Robert Oppenheimer and his fellow architects of the atomic bomb.
Nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into collective suicide,
and made it impossible to seek world domination by force of arms.
Secondly, while the price of war soared, its proɹts declined. For most of history,
polities could enrich themselves by looting or annexing enemy territories. Most
wealth consisted of ɹelds, cattle, slaves and gold, so it was easy to loot it or
occupy it. Today, wealth consists mainly of human capital, technical know-how
and complex socio-economic structures such as banks. Consequently it is diɽcult
to carry it off or incorporate it into one’s territory.
Consider California. Its wealth was initially built on gold mines. But today it is
built on silicon and celluloid – Silicon Valley and the celluloid hills of Hollywood.
What would happen if the Chinese were to mount an armed invasion of
California, land a million soldiers on the beaches of San Francisco and storm
inland? They would gain little. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley. The
wealth resides in the minds of Google engineers and Hollywood script doctors,
directors and special-eʃects wizards, who would be on the ɹrst plane to Bangalore
or Mumbai long before the Chinese tanks rolled into Sunset Boulevard. It is not
coincidental that the few full-scale international wars that still take place in the

world, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, occur in places were wealth is old-
fashioned material wealth. The Kuwaiti sheikhs could ɻee abroad, but the oil ɹelds

stayed put and were occupied.

43. and 44. Gold miners in California during the Gold Rush, and Facebook’s headquarters near San

Francisco. In 1849 California built its fortunes on gold. Today, California builds its fortunes on silicon.
But whereas in 1849 the gold actually lay there in the Californian soil, the real treasures of Silicon Valley

are locked inside the heads of high-tech employees.

While war became less proɹtable, peace became more lucrative than ever. In
traditional agricultural economies long-distance trade and foreign investment
were sideshows. Consequently, peace brought little proɹt, aside from avoiding the
costs of war. If, say, in 1400 England and France were at peace, the French did
not have to pay heavy war taxes and to suʃer destructive English invasions, but
otherwise it did not beneɹt their wallets. In modern capitalist economies, foreign
trade and investments have become all-important. Peace therefore brings unique
dividends. As long as China and the USA are at peace, the Chinese can prosper by
selling products to the USA, trading in Wall Street and receiving US investments.
Last but not least, a tectonic shift has taken place in global political culture.
Many elites in history – Hun chieftains, Viking noblemen and Aztec priests, for
example – viewed war as a positive good. Others viewed it as evil, but an
inevitable one, which we had better turn to our own advantage. Ours is the ɹrst
time in history that the world is dominated by a peace-loving elite – politicians,
business people, intellectuals and artists who genuinely see war as both evil and
avoidable. (There were paciɹsts in the past, such as the early Christians, but in the
rare cases that they gained power, they tended to forget about their requirement
to ‘turn the other cheek’.)
There is a positive feedback loop between all these four factors. The threat of
nuclear holocaust fosters paciɹsm; when paciɹsm spreads, war recedes and trade
ɻourishes; and trade increases both the proɹts of peace and the costs of war. Over
time, this feedback loop creates another obstacle to war, which may ultimately
prove the most important of all. The tightening web of international connections
erodes the independence of most countries, lessening the chance that any one of
them might single-handedly let slip the dogs of war. Most countries no longer
engage in full-scale war for the simple reason that they are no longer
independent. Though citizens in Israel, Italy, Mexico or Thailand may harbour
illusions of independence, the fact is that their governments cannot conduct
independent economic or foreign policies, and they are certainly incapable of
initiating and conducting full-scale war on their own. As explained in Chapter 11,
we are witnessing the formation of a global empire. Like previous empires, this
one, too, enforces peace within its borders. And since its borders cover the entire
globe, the World Empire effectively enforces world peace.
So, is the modern era one of mindless slaughter, war and oppression, typiɹed by
the trenches of World War One, the nuclear mushroom cloud over Hiroshima and

the gory manias of Hitler and Stalin? Or is it an era of peace, epitomised by the
trenches never dug in South America, the mushroom clouds that never appeared
over Moscow and New York, and the serene visages of Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King?
The answer is a matter of timing. It is sobering to realise how often our view of
the past is distorted by events of the last few years. If this chapter had been
written in 1945 or 1962, it would probably have been much more glum. Since it
was written in 2014, it takes a relatively buoyant approach to modern history.
To satisfy both optimists and pessimists, we may conclude by saying that we are
on the threshold of both heaven and hell, moving nervously between the gateway
of the one and the anteroom of the other. History has still not decided where we
will end up, and a string of coincidences might yet send us rolling in either
direction.

And They Lived Happily Ever After

THE LAST 500 YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A breathtaking series of revolutions. The
earth has been united into a single ecological and historical sphere. The economy
has grown exponentially, and humankind today enjoys the kind of wealth that
used to be the stuʃ of fairy tales. Science and the Industrial Revolution have given
humankind superhuman powers and practically limitless energy. The social order
has been completely transformed, as have politics, daily life and human
psychology.
But are we happier? Did the wealth humankind accumulated over the last ɹve
centuries translate into a new-found contentment? Did the discovery of
inexhaustible energy resources open before us inexhaustible stores of bliss? Going
further back, have the seventy or so turbulent millennia since the Cognitive
Revolution made the world a better place to live? Was the late Neil Armstrong,
whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless
hunter-gatherer who 30,000 years ago left her handprint on a wall in Chauvet
Cave? If not, what was the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing,
coinage, empires, science and industry?
Historians seldom ask such questions. They do not ask whether the citizens of
Uruk and Babylon were happier than their foraging ancestors, whether the rise of
Islam made Egyptians more pleased with their lives, or how the collapse of the
European empires in Africa have inɻuenced the happiness of countless millions.
Yet these are the most important questions one can ask of history. Most current
ideologies and political programmes are based on rather ɻimsy ideas concerning

the real source of human happiness. Nationalists believe that political self-
determination is essential for our happiness. Communists postulate that everyone

would be blissful under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Capitalists maintain
that only the free market can ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest
number, by creating economic growth and material abundance and by teaching
people to be self-reliant and enterprising.
What would happen if serious research were to disprove these hypotheses? If
economic growth and self-reliance do not make people happier, what’s the beneɹt
of Capitalism? What if it turns out that the subjects of large empires are generally

happier than the citizens of independent states and that, for example, Algerians
were happier under French rule than under their own? What would that say about
the process of decolonisation and the value of national self-determination?
These are all hypothetical possibilities, because so far historians have avoided
raising these questions – not to mention answering them. They have researched
the history of just about everything politics, society, economics, gender, diseases,
sexuality, food, clothing – yet they have seldom stopped to ask how these
influence human happiness.
Though few have studied the long-term history of happiness, almost every
scholar and layperson has some vague preconception about it. In one common
view, human capabilities have increased throughout history. Since humans
generally use their capabilities to alleviate miseries and fulɹl aspirations, it
follows that we must be happier than our medieval ancestors, and they must have
been happier than Stone Age hunter-gatherers.
But this progressive account is unconvincing. As we have seen, new aptitudes,
behaviours and skills do not necessarily make for a better life. When humans
learned to farm in the Agricultural Revolution, their collective power to shape
their environment increased, but the lot of many individual humans grew harsher.
Peasants had to work harder than foragers to eke out less varied and nutritious
food, and they were far more exposed to disease and exploitation. Similarly, the
spread of European empires greatly increased the collective power of humankind,
by circulating ideas, technologies and crops, and opening new avenues of
commerce. Yet this was hardly good news for millions of Africans, Native
Americans and Aboriginal Australians. Given the proven human propensity for
misusing power, it seems naïve to believe that the more clout people have, the
happier they will be.
Some challengers of this view take a diametrically opposed position. They argue
for a reverse correlation between human capabilities and happiness. Power
corrupts, they say, and as humankind gained more and more power, it created a
cold mechanistic world ill-suited to our real needs. Evolution moulded our minds
and bodies to the life of hunter-gatherers. The transition ɹrst to agriculture and
then to industry has condemned us to living unnatural lives that cannot give full
expression to our inherent inclinations and instincts, and therefore cannot satisfy
our deepest yearnings. Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class
can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on
a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between
us and the Garden of Eden.
Yet this romantic insistence on seeing a dark shadow behind each invention is
as dogmatic as the belief in the inevitability of progress. Perhaps we are out of
touch with our inner hunter-gatherer, but it’s not all bad. For instance, over the

last two centuries modern medicine has decreased child mortality from 33 per cent
to less than 5 per cent. Can anyone doubt that this made a huge contribution to
the happiness not only of those children who would otherwise have died, but also
of their families and friends?
A more nuanced position takes the middle road. Until the Scientiɹc Revolution
there was no clear correlation between power and happiness. Medieval peasants
may indeed have been more miserable than their hunter-gatherer forebears. But in
the last few centuries humans have learned to use their capacities more wisely.
The triumphs of modern medicine are just one example. Other unprecedented
achievements include the steep drop in violence, the virtual disappearance of
international wars, and the near elimination of large-scale famines.
Yet this, too, is an oversimpliɹcation. Firstly, it bases its optimistic assessment
on a very small sample of years. The majority of humans began to enjoy the fruits
of modern medicine no earlier than 1850, and the drastic drop in child mortality is
a twentieth-century phenomenon. Mass famines continued to blight much of
humanity up to the middle of the twentieth century. During Communist Chinas
Great Leap Forward of 1958–61, somewhere between 10 and 50 million human
beings starved to death. International wars became rare only after 1945, largely
thanks to the new threat of nuclear annihilation. Hence, though the last few
decades have been an unprecedented golden age for humanity, it is too early to
know whether this represents a fundamental shift in the currents of history or an
ephemeral eddy of good fortune. When judging modernity, it is all too tempting to
take the viewpoint of a twenty-ɹrst-century middle-class Westerner. We must not
forget the viewpoints of a nineteenth-century Welsh coal miner, Chinese opium
addict or Tasmanian Aborigine. Truganini is no less important than Homer
Simpson.
Secondly, even the brief golden age of the last half-century may turn out to
have sown the seeds of future catastrophe. Over the last few decades, we have
been disturbing the ecological equilibrium of our planet in myriad new ways, with
what seem likely to be dire consequences. A lot of evidence indicates that we are
destroying the foundations of human prosperity in an orgy of reckless
consumption.
Finally, we can congratulate ourselves on the unprecedented accomplishments
of modern Sapiens only if we completely ignore the fate of all other animals.
Much of the vaunted material wealth that shields us from disease and famine was
accumulated at the expense of laboratory monkeys, dairy cows and conveyor-belt
chickens. Over the last two centuries tens of billions of them have been subjected
to a regime of industrial exploitation whose cruelty has no precedent in the annals
of planet Earth. If we accept a mere tenth of what animal-rights activists are
claiming, then modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in

history. When evaluating global happiness, it is wrong to count the happiness
only of the upper classes, of Europeans or of men. Perhaps it is also wrong to
consider only the happiness of humans.

Counting Happiness

So far we have discussed happiness as if it were largely a product of material
factors, such as health, diet and wealth. If people are richer and healthier, then
they must also be happier. But is that really so obvious? Philosophers, priests and
poets have brooded over the nature of happiness for millennia, and many have
concluded that social, ethical and spiritual factors have as great an impact on our
happiness as material conditions. Perhaps people in modern aʀuent societies
suʃer greatly from alienation and meaninglessness despite their prosperity. And
perhaps our less well-to-do ancestors found much contentment in community,
religion and a bond with nature.
In recent decades, psychologists and biologists have taken up the challenge of
studying scientiɹcally what really makes people happy. Is it money, family,
genetics or perhaps virtue? The ɹrst step is to deɹne what is to be measured. The
generally accepted deɹnition of happiness is ‘subjective well-being’. Happiness,
according to this view, is something I feel inside myself, a sense of either
immediate pleasure or long-term contentment with the way my life is going. If it’s
something felt inside, how can it be measured from outside? Presumably, we can
do so by asking people to tell us how they feel. So psychologists or biologists who
want to assess how happy people feel give them questionnaires to ɹll out and
tally the results.
A typical subjective well-being questionnaire asks interviewees to grade on a
scale of zero to ten their agreement with statements such as ‘I feel pleased with
the way I am’, ‘I feel that life is very rewarding’, ‘I am optimistic about the future’
and ‘Life is good’. The researcher then adds up all the answers and calculates the
interviewee’s general level of subjective well-being.
Such questionnaires are used in order to correlate happiness with various
objective factors. One study might compare a thousand people who earn $100,000
a year with a thousand people who earn $50,000. If the study discovers that the
ɹrst group has an average subjective well-being level of 8.7, while the latter has
an average of only 7.3, the researcher may reasonably conclude that there is a
positive correlation between wealth and subjective well-being. To put it in simple
English, money brings happiness. The same method can be used to examine
whether people living in democracies are happier than people living in

dictatorships, and whether married people are happier than singles, divorcees or
widowers.
This provides a grounding for historians, who can examine wealth, political
freedom and divorce rates in the past. If people are happier in democracies and
married people are happier than divorcees, a historian has a basis for arguing that
the democratisation process of the last few decades contributed to the happiness of
humankind, whereas the growing rates of divorce indicate an opposite trend.
This way of thinking is not ɻawless, but before pointing out some of the holes,
it is worth considering the findings.
One interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only
up to a point, and beyond that point it has little signiɹcance. For people stuck at
the bottom of the economic ladder, more money means greater happiness. If you
are an American single mother earning $12,000 a year cleaning houses and you
suddenly win $500,000 in the lottery, you will probably experience a signiɹcant
and long-term surge in your subjective well-being. You’ll be able to feed and
clothe your children without sinking further into debt. However, if you’re a top
executive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million in the lottery, or your
company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your surge is likely to last
only a few weeks. According to the empirical ɹndings, it’s almost certainly not
going to make a big diʃerence to the way you feel over the long run. You’ll buy a
snazzier car, move into a palatial home, get used to drinking Chateau Pétrus
instead of California Cabernet, but it’ll soon all seem routine and unexceptional.
Another interesting ɹnding is that illness decreases happiness in the short term,
but is a source of long-term distress only if a person’s condition is constantly
deteriorating or if the disease involves ongoing and debilitating pain. People who
are diagnosed with chronic illness such as diabetes are usually depressed for a
while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and
rate their happiness as highly as healthy people do. Imagine that Lucy and Luke
are middle-class twins, who agree to take part in a subjective well-being study. On
the way back from the psychology laboratory, Lucy’s car is hit by a bus, leaving
Lucy with a number of broken bones and a permanently lame leg. Just as the
rescue crew is cutting her out of the wreckage, the phone rings and Luke shouts
that he has won the lottery’s $10,000,000 jackpot. Two years later she’ll be
limping and he’ll be a lot richer, but when the psychologist comes around for a
follow-up study, they are both likely to give the same answers they did on the
morning of that fateful day.
Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money
and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive
communities are signiɹcantly happier than people whose families are
dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be

part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that

there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-
being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true irrespective of

economic or even physical conditions. An impecunious invalid surrounded by a
loving spouse, a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than
an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalid’s poverty is not too severe and
that his illness is not degenerative or painful.
This raises the possibility that the immense improvement in material conditions
over the last two centuries was oʃset by the collapse of the family and the
community. If so, the average person might well be no happier today than in
1800. Even the freedom we value so highly may be working against us. We can
choose our spouses, friends and neighbours, but they can choose to leave us. With
the individual wielding unprecedented power to decide her own path in life, we
ɹnd it ever harder to make commitments. We thus live in an increasingly lonely
world of unravelling communities and families.
But the most important ɹnding of all is that happiness does not really depend
on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it
depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective
expectations. If you want a bullock-cart and get a bullock-cart, you are content. If
you want a brand-new Ferrari and get only a second-hand Fiat you feel deprived.
This is why winning the lottery has, over time, the same impact on people’s
happiness as a debilitating car accident. When things improve, expectations
balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions
can leave us dissatisɹed. When things deteriorate, expectations shrink, and
consequently even a severe illness might leave you pretty much as happy as you
were before.
You might say that we didn’t need a bunch of psychologists and their
questionnaires to discover this. Prophets, poets and philosophers realised
thousands of years ago that being satisɹed with what you already have is far more
important than getting more of what you want. Still, it’s nice when modern
research – bolstered by lots of numbers and charts – reaches the same conclusions
the ancients did.

The crucial importance of human expectations has far-reaching implications for
understanding the history of happiness. If happiness depended only on objective
conditions such as wealth, health and social relations, it would have been
relatively easy to investigate its history. The ɹnding that it depends on subjective
expectations makes the task of historians far harder. We moderns have an arsenal
of tranquillisers and painkillers at our disposal, but our expectations of ease and
pleasure, and our intolerance of inconvenience and discomfort, have increased to

such an extent that we may well suʃer from pain more than our ancestors ever
did.
It’s hard to accept this line of thinking. The problem is a fallacy of reasoning
embedded deep in our psyches. When we try to guess or imagine how happy other
people are now, or how people in the past were, we inevitably imagine ourselves
in their shoes. But that won’t work because it pastes our expectations on to the
material conditions of others. In modern aʀuent societies it is customary to take a
shower and change your clothes every day. Medieval peasants went without
washing for months on end, and hardly ever changed their clothes. The very
thought of living like that, ɹlthy and reeking to the bone, is abhorrent to us. Yet
medieval peasants seem not to have minded. They were used to the feel and smell
of a long-unlaundered shirt. It’s not that they wanted a change of clothes but
couldn’t get it – they had what they wanted. So, at least as far as clothing goes,
they were content.
That’s not so surprising, when you think of it. After all, our chimpanzee cousins
seldom wash and never change their clothes. Nor are we disgusted by the fact that
our pet dogs and cats don’t shower or change their coats daily. We pat, hug and
kiss them all the same. Small children in aʀuent societies often dislike showering,
and it takes them years of education and parental discipline to adopt this
supposedly attractive custom. It is all a matter of expectations.
If happiness is determined by expectations, then two pillars of our society –
mass media and the advertising industry – may unwittingly be depleting the
globe’s reservoirs of contentment. If you were an eighteen-year-old youth in a
small village 5,000 years ago you’d probably think you were good-looking because
there were only ɹfty other men in your village and most of them were either old,
scarred and wrinkled, or still little kids. But if you are a teenager today you are a
lot more likely to feel inadequate. Even if the other guys at school are an ugly lot,
you don’t measure yourself against them but against the movie stars, athletes and
supermodels you see all day on television, Facebook and giant billboards.
So maybe Third World discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease,
corruption and political oppression but also by mere exposure to First World
standards. The average Egyptian was far less likely to die from starvation, plague
or violence under Hosni Mubarak than under Ramses II or Cleopatra. Never had
the material condition of most Egyptians been so good. You’d think they would
have been dancing in the streets in 2011, thanking Allah for their good fortune.
Instead they rose up furiously to overthrow Mubarak. They weren’t comparing
themselves to their ancestors under the pharaohs, but rather to their
contemporaries in Obama’s America.
If that’s the case, even immortality might lead to discontent. Suppose science
comes up with cures for all diseases, eʃective anti-ageing therapies and

regenerative treatments that keep people indeɹnitely young. In all likelihood, the
immediate result will be an unprecedented epidemic of anger and anxiety.
Those unable to aʃord the new miracle treatments – the vast majority of people
– will be beside themselves with rage. Throughout history, the poor and oppressed
comforted themselves with the thought that at least death is even-handed – that
the rich and powerful will also die. The poor will not be comfortable with the
thought that they have to die, while the rich will remain young and beautiful for
ever.

45. In previous eras the standard of beauty was set by the handful of people who lived next door to you.
Today the media and the fashion industry expose us to a totally unrealistic standard of beauty. They
search out the most gorgeous people on the planet, and then parade them constantly before our eyes. No

wonder we are far less happy with the way we look.

But the tiny minority able to aʃord the new treatments will not be euphoric
either. They will have much to be anxious about. Although the new therapies could
extend life and youth, they cannot revive corpses. How dreadful to think that I
and my loved ones can live for ever, but only if we don’t get hit by a truck or
blown to smithereens by a terrorist! Potentially a-mortal people are likely to grow
averse to taking even the slightest risk, and the agony of losing a spouse, child or
close friend will be unbearable.

Chemical Happiness

Social scientists distribute subjective well-being questionnaires and correlate the
results with socio-economic factors such as wealth and political freedom. Biologists
use the same questionnaires, but correlate the answers people give them with
biochemical and genetic factors. Their findings are shocking.
Biologists hold that our mental and emotional world is governed by biochemical
mechanisms shaped by millions of years of evolution. Like all other mental states,
our subjective well-being is not determined by external parameters such as salary,
social relations or political rights. Rather, it is determined by a complex system of
nerves, neurons, synapses and various biochemical substances such as serotonin,
dopamine and oxytocin.
Nobody is ever made happy by winning the lottery, buying a house, getting a
promotion or even ɹnding true love. People are made happy by one thing and
one thing only – pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who just won the
lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is not really reacting to the money
or the lover. She is reacting to various hormones coursing through her
bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals ɻashing between diʃerent parts
of her brain.
Unfortunately for all hopes of creating heaven on earth, our internal
biochemical system seems to be programmed to keep happiness levels relatively
constant. There’s no natural selection for happiness as such – a happy hermit’s
genetic line will go extinct as the genes of a pair of anxious parents get carried on
to the next generation. Happiness and misery play a role in evolution only to the
extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction. Perhaps it’s
not surprising, then, that evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor
too happy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but
these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant
sensations.
For example, evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males who
spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied
by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure
that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the
very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not
take the trouble to look for additional fertile females.
Some scholars compare human biochemistry to an air-conditioning system that
keeps the temperature constant, come heatwave or snowstorm. Events might
momentarily change the temperature, but the air-conditioning system always
returns the temperature to the same set point.
Some air-conditioning systems are set at twenty-ɹve degrees Celsius. Others are

set at twenty degrees. Human happiness conditioning systems also diʃer from
person to person. On a scale from one to ten, some people are born with a
cheerful biochemical system that allows their mood to swing between levels six
and ten, stabilising with time at eight. Such a person is quite happy even if she
lives in an alienating big city, loses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is
diagnosed with diabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that
swings between three and seven and stabilises at ɹve. Such an unhappy person
remains depressed even if she enjoys the support of a tight-knit community, wins
millions in the lottery and is as healthy as an Olympic athlete. Indeed, even if our
gloomy friend wins $50,000,000 in the morning, discovers the cure for both AIDS
and cancer by noon, makes peace between Israelis and Palestinians that
afternoon, and then in the evening reunites with her long-lost child who
disappeared years ago – she would still be incapable of experiencing anything
beyond level seven happiness. Her brain is simply not built for exhilaration, come
what may.
Think for a moment of your family and friends. You know some people who
remain relatively joyful, no matter what befalls them. And then there are those
who are always disgruntled, no matter what gifts the world lays at their feet. We
tend to believe that if we could just change our workplace, get married, ɹnish
writing that novel, buy a new car or repay the mortgage, we would be on top of
the world. Yet when we get what we desire we don’t seem to be any happier.
Buying cars and writing novels do not change our biochemistry. They can startle it
for a fleeting moment, but it is soon back to its set point.

How can this be squared with the above-mentioned psychological and sociological
ɹndings that, for example, married people are happier on average than singles?
First, these ɹndings are correlations – the direction of causation may be the
opposite of what some researchers have assumed. It is true that married people
are happier than singles and divorcees, but that does not necessarily mean that
marriage produces happiness. It could be that happiness causes marriage. Or more
correctly, that serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin bring about and maintain a
marriage. People who are born with a cheerful biochemistry are generally happy
and content. Such people are more attractive spouses, and consequently they have
a greater chance of getting married. They are also less likely to divorce, because it
is far easier to live with a happy and content spouse than with a depressed and
dissatisɹed one. Consequently, it’s true that married people are happier on
average than singles, but a single woman prone to gloom because of her
biochemistry would not necessarily become happier if she were to hook up with a
husband.
In addition, most biologists are not fanatics. They maintain that happiness is

determined mainly by biochemistry, but they agree that psychological and
sociological factors also have their place. Our mental air-conditioning system has
some freedom of movement within predetermined borders. It is almost impossible
to exceed the upper and lower emotional boundaries, but marriage and divorce
can have an impact in the area between the two. Somebody born with an average
of level ɹve happiness would never dance wildly in the streets. But a good
marriage should enable her to enjoy level seven from time to time, and to avoid
the despondency of level three.
If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be
of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our
biochemistry. History can change the external stimuli that cause serotonin to be
secreted, yet it does not change the resulting serotonin levels, and hence it cannot
make people happier.
Compare a medieval French peasant to a modern Parisian banker. The peasant
lived in an unheated mud hut overlooking the local pigsty, while the banker goes
home to a splendid penthouse with all the latest technological gadgets and a view
to the Champs-Elysées. Intuitively, we would expect the banker to be much

happier than the peasant. However, mud huts, penthouses and the Champs-
Elysées don’t really determine our mood. Serotonin does. When the medieval

peasant completed the construction of his mud hut, his brain neurons secreted
serotonin, bringing it up to level X. When in 2014 the banker made the last
payment on his wonderful penthouse, brain neurons secreted a similar amount of
serotonin, bringing it up to a similar level X. It makes no diʃerence to the brain
that the penthouse is far more comfortable than the mud hut. The only thing that
matters is that at present the level of serotonin is X. Consequently the banker
would not be one iota happier than his great-great-great-grandfather, the poor
medieval peasant.
This is true not only of private lives, but also of great collective events. Take,
for example, the French Revolution. The revolutionaries were busy: they executed
the king, gave lands to the peasants, declared the rights of man, abolished noble
privileges and waged war against the whole of Europe. Yet none of that changed
French biochemistry. Consequently, despite all the political, social, ideological and
economic upheavals brought about by the revolution, its impact on French
happiness was small. Those who won a cheerful biochemistry in the genetic lottery
were just as happy before the revolution as after. Those with a gloomy
biochemistry complained about Robespierre and Napoleon with the same
bitterness with which they earlier complained about Louis XVI and Marie
Antoinette.
If so, what good was the French Revolution? If people did not become any
happier, then what was the point of all that chaos, fear, blood and war? Biologists

would never have stormed the Bastille. People think that this political revolution
or that social reform will make them happy, but their biochemistry tricks them
time and again.
There is only one historical development that has real significance. Today, when
we ɹnally realise that the keys to happiness are in the hands of our biochemical
system, we can stop wasting our time on politics and social reforms, putsches and
ideologies, and focus instead on the only thing that can make us truly happy:
manipulating our biochemistry. If we invest billions in understanding our brain
chemistry and developing appropriate treatments, we can make people far
happier than ever before, without any need of revolutions. Prozac, for example,
does not change regimes, but by raising serotonin levels it lifts people out of their
depression.
Nothing captures the biological argument better than the famous New Age
slogan: ‘Happiness Begins Within.’ Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful
houses, powerful positions – none of these will bring you happiness. Lasting
happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin.1
In Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel Brave New World, published in 1932 at the
height of the Great Depression, happiness is the supreme value and psychiatric
drugs replace the police and the ballot as the foundation of politics. Each day,
each person takes a dose of ‘soma’, a synthetic drug which makes people happy
without harming their productivity and eɽciency. The World State that governs
the entire globe is never threatened by wars, revolutions, strikes or
demonstrations, because all people are supremely content with their current
conditions, whatever they may be. Huxley’s vision of the future is far more
troubling than George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Huxley’s world seems
monstrous to most readers, but it is hard to explain why. Everybody is happy all
the time – what could be wrong with that?

The Meaning of Life

Huxley’s disconcerting world is based on the biological assumption that happiness
equals pleasure. To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant
bodily sensations. Since our biochemistry limits the volume and duration of these
sensations, the only way to make people experience a high level of happiness over
an extended period of time is to manipulate their biochemical system.
But that deɹnition of happiness is contested by some scholars. In a famous
study, Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, asked people to
recount a typical work day, going through it episode by episode and evaluating

how much they enjoyed or disliked each moment. He discovered what seems to be
a paradox in most people’s view of their lives. Take the work involved in raising a
child. Kahneman found that when counting moments of joy and moments of
drudgery, bringing up a child turns out to be a rather unpleasant aʃair. It consists
largely of changing nappies, washing dishes and dealing with temper tantrums,
which nobody likes to do. Yet most parents declare that their children are their
chief source of happiness. Does it mean that people don’t really know what’s good
for them?
That’s one option. Another is that the findings demonstrate that happiness is not
the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in
seeing one’s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. There is an
important cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the
diʃerence to whether we see ourselves as ‘miserable slaves to a baby dictator’ or
as ‘lovingly nurturing a new life’.2 As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live,
you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even
in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter
how comfortable it is.
Though people in all cultures and eras have felt the same type of pleasures and
pains, the meaning they have ascribed to their experiences has probably varied
widely. If so, the history of happiness might have been far more turbulent than
biologists imagine. It’s a conclusion that does not necessarily favour modernity.
Assessing life minute by minute, medieval people certainly had it rough. However,
if they believed the promise of everlasting bliss in the afterlife, they may well
have viewed their lives as far more meaningful and worthwhile than modern
secular people, who in the long term can expect nothing but complete and
meaningless oblivion. Asked ‘Are you satisɹed with your life as a whole?’, people
in the Middle Ages might have scored quite highly in a subjective well-being
questionnaire.
So our medieval ancestors were happy because they found meaning to life in
collective delusions about the afterlife? Yes. As long as nobody punctured their
fantasies, why shouldn’t they? As far as we can tell, from a purely scientiɹc
viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of
blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are
not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to blow up
tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as
usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed.

Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. The other-
worldly meanings medieval people found in their lives were no more deluded than

the modern humanist, nationalist and capitalist meanings modern people ɹnd.
The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of

human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he
ɹghts to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who ɹnds meaning in
building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts
who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new
cathedral.
So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with
the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with
the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is
meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction.

This is quite a depressing conclusion. Does happiness really depend on self-
delusion?

Know Thyself

If happiness is based on feeling pleasant sensations, then in order to be happier
we need to re-engineer our biochemical system. If happiness is based on feeling
that life is meaningful, then in order to be happier we need to delude ourselves
more effectively. Is there a third alternative?
Both the above views share the assumption that happiness is some sort of
subjective feeling (of either pleasure or meaning), and that in order to judge
people’s happiness, all we need to do is ask them how they feel. To many of us,
that seems logical because the dominant religion of our age is liberalism.
Liberalism sanctiɹes the subjective feelings of individuals. It views these feelings
as the supreme source of authority. What is good and what is bad, what is
beautiful and what is ugly, what ought to be and what ought not to be, are all
determined by what each one of us feels.
Liberal politics is based on the idea that the voters know best, and there is no
need for Big Brother to tell us what is good for us. Liberal economics is based on
the idea that the customer is always right. Liberal art declares that beauty is in the
eye of the beholder. Students in liberal schools and universities are taught to think
for themselves. Commercials urge us to ‘Just do it!’ Action ɹlms, stage dramas,
soap operas, novels and catchy pop songs indoctrinate us constantly: ‘Be true to
yourself’, ‘Listen to yourself’, ‘Follow your heart’. Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated
this view most classically: ‘What I feel to be good – is good. What I feel to be bad –
is bad.’
People who have been raised from infancy on a diet of such slogans are prone
to believe that happiness is a subjective feeling and that each individual best
knows whether she is happy or miserable. Yet this view is unique to liberalism.

Most religions and ideologies throughout history stated that there are objective
yardsticks for goodness and beauty, and for how things ought to be. They were
suspicious of the feelings and preferences of the ordinary person. At the entrance
of the temple of Apollo at Delphi, pilgrims were greeted by the inscription: ‘Know
thyself!’ The implication was that the average person is ignorant of his true self,
and is therefore likely to be ignorant of true happiness. Freud would probably
concur.*
And so would Christian theologians. St Paul and St Augustine knew perfectly
well that if you asked people about it, most of them would prefer to have sex than
pray to God. Does that prove that having sex is the key to happiness? Not
according to Paul and Augustine. It proves only that humankind is sinful by
nature, and that people are easily seduced by Satan. From a Christian viewpoint,
the vast majority of people are in more or less the same situation as heroin
addicts. Imagine that a psychologist embarks on a study of happiness among drug
users. He polls them and ɹnds that they declare, every single one of them, that
they are only happy when they shoot up. Would the psychologist publish a paper
declaring that heroin is the key to happiness?
The idea that feelings are not to be trusted is not restricted to Christianity. At
least when it comes to the value of feelings, even Darwin and Dawkins might ɹnd
common ground with St Paul and St Augustine. According to the selɹsh gene
theory, natural selection makes people, like other organisms, choose what is good
for the reproduction of their genes, even if it is bad for them as individuals. Most
males spend their lives toiling, worrying, competing and ɹghting, instead of
enjoying peaceful bliss, because their DNA manipulates them for its own selɹsh
aims. Like Satan, DNA uses ɻeeting pleasures to tempt people and place them in
its power.
Most religions and philosophies have consequently taken a very diʃerent
approach to happiness than liberalism does.3 The Buddhist position is particularly
interesting. Buddhism has assigned the question of happiness more importance
than perhaps any other human creed. For 2,500 years, Buddhists have
systematically studied the essence and causes of happiness, which is why there is a
growing interest among the scientiɹc community both in their philosophy and
their meditation practices.
Buddhism shares the basic insight of the biological approach to happiness,
namely that happiness results from processes occurring within one’s body, and not
from events in the outside world. However, starting from the same insight,
Buddhism reaches very different conclusions.
According to Buddhism, most people identify happiness with pleasant feelings,
while identifying suʃering with unpleasant feelings. People consequently ascribe
immense importance to what they feel, craving to experience more and more

pleasures, while avoiding pain. Whatever we do throughout our lives, whether
scratching our leg, ɹdgeting slightly in the chair, or ɹghting world wars, we are
just trying to get pleasant feelings.
The problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more than
ɻeeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If ɹve minutes
ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel
sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly
chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I
immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward
for my troubles.
What is so important about obtaining such ephemeral prizes? Why struggle so
hard to achieve something that disappears almost as soon as it arises? According
to Buddhism, the root of suʃering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor
even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suʃering is this never-ending
and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant
state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is
never satisɹed. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it
fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay
and intensify.
People are liberated from suʃering not when they experience this or that
ɻeeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all
their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation
practices. In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body,
witness the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and realise how
pointless it is to pursue them. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very
relaxed, clear and satisɹed. All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing – joy,
anger, boredom, lust – but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can just
accept them for what they are. You live in the present moment instead of
fantasising about what might have been.
The resulting serenity is so profound that those who spend their lives in the
frenzied pursuit of pleasant feelings can hardly imagine it. It is like a man
standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain ‘good’ waves and trying
to prevent them from disintegrating, while simultaneously pushing back ‘bad’
waves to prevent them from getting near him. Day in, day out, the man stands on
the beach, driving himself crazy with this fruitless exercise. Eventually, he sits
down on the sand and just allows the waves to come and go as they please. How
peaceful!
This idea is so alien to modern liberal culture that when Western New Age
movements encountered Buddhist insights, they translated them into liberal terms,
thereby turning them on their head. New Age cults frequently argue: ‘Happiness

does not depend on external conditions. It depends only on what we feel inside.
People should stop pursuing external achievements such as wealth and status, and
connect instead with their inner feelings.’ Or more succinctly, ‘Happiness Begins
Within.’ This is exactly what biologists argue, but more or less the opposite of
what Buddha said.
Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is
independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more
profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings.
Indeed, the more signiɹcance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and
the more we suʃer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of
external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.

To sum up, subjective well-being questionnaires identify our well-being with our
subjective feelings, and identify the pursuit of happiness with the pursuit of
particular emotional states. In contrast, for many traditional philosophies and
religions, such as Buddhism, the key to happiness is to know the truth about
yourself – to understand who, or what, you really are. Most people wrongly
identify themselves with their feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes. When they feel
anger, they think, ‘I am angry. This is my anger.’ They consequently spend their
life avoiding some kinds of feelings and pursuing others. They never realise that
they are not their feelings, and that the relentless pursuit of particular feelings just
traps them in misery.
If this is so, then our entire understanding of the history of happiness might be
misguided. Maybe it isn’t so important whether people’s expectations are fulɹlled
and whether they enjoy pleasant feelings. The main question is whether people
know the truth about themselves. What evidence do we have that people today
understand this truth any better than ancient foragers or medieval peasants?
Scholars began to study the history of happiness only a few years ago, and we
are still formulating initial hypotheses and searching for appropriate research
methods. It’s much too early to adopt rigid conclusions and end a debate that’s
hardly yet begun. What is important is to get to know as many diʃerent
approaches as possible and to ask the right questions.
Most history books focus on the ideas of great thinkers, the bravery of warriors,
the charity of saints and the creativity of artists. They have much to tell about the
weaving and unravelling of social structures, about the rise and fall of empires,
about the discovery and spread of technologies. Yet they say nothing about how
all this inɻuenced the happiness and suʃering of individuals. This is the biggest
lacuna in our understanding of history. We had better start filling it.

* Paradoxically, while psychological studies of subjective well-being rely on people’s ability to diagnose their

happiness correctly, the basic raison d’être of psychotherapy is that people don’t really know themselves and that
they sometimes need professional help to free themselves of self-destructive behaviours.

The End of Homo Sapiens

THIS BOOK BEGAN BY PRESENTING HISTORY as the next stage in the continuum
of physics to chemistry to biology. Sapiens are subject to the same physical forces,
chemical reactions and natural-selection processes that govern all living beings.
Natural selection may have provided Homo sapiens with a much larger playing
ɹeld than it has given to any other organism, but the ɹeld has still had its
boundaries. The implication has been that, no matter what their eʃorts and
achievements, Sapiens are incapable of breaking free of their biologically
determined limits.
But at the dawn of the twenty-ɹrst century, this is no longer true: Homo sapiens
is transcending those limits. It is now beginning to break the laws of natural
selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design.
For close to 4 billion years, every single organism on the planet evolved subject
to natural selection. Not even one was designed by an intelligent creator. The
giraʃe, for example, got its long neck thanks to competition between archaic
giraʃes rather than to the whims of a super-intelligent being. Proto-giraʃes who
had longer necks had access to more food and consequently produced more
oʃspring than did those with shorter necks. Nobody, certainly not the giraʃes,
said, ‘A long neck would enable giraʃes to munch leaves oʃ the treetops. Let’s
extend it.’ The beauty of Darwin’s theory is that it does not need to assume an
intelligent designer to explain how giraffes ended up with long necks.
For billions of years, intelligent design was not even an option, because there
was no intelligence which could design things. Microorganisms, which until quite
recently were the only living things around, are capable of amazing feats. A
microorganism belonging to one species can incorporate genetic codes from a
completely diʃerent species into its cell and thereby gain new capabilities, such as
resistance to antibiotics. Yet, as best we know, microorganisms have no
consciousness, no aims in life, and no ability to plan ahead.
At some stage organisms such as giraʃes, dolphins, chimpanzees and
Neanderthals evolved consciousness and the ability to plan ahead. But even if a
Neanderthal fantasised about fowls so fat and slow-moving that he could just
scoop them up whenever he was hungry, he had no way of turning that fantasy

into reality. He had to hunt the birds that had been naturally selected.
The ɹrst crack in the old regime appeared about 10,000 years ago, during the
Agricultural Revolution. Sapiens who dreamed of fat, slow-moving chickens
discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock, some of their
oʃspring would be both fat and slow. If you mated those oʃspring with each
other, you could produce a line of fat, slow birds. It was a race of chickens
unknown to nature, produced by the intelligent design not of a god but of a
human.
Still, compared to an all-powerful deity, Homo sapiens had limited design skills.

Sapiens could use selective breeding to detour around and accelerate the natural-
selection processes that normally aʃected chickens, but they could not introduce

completely new characteristics that were absent from the genetic pool of wild
chickens. In a way, the relationship between Homo sapiens and chickens was
similar to many other symbiotic relationships that have so often arisen on their
own in nature. Sapiens exerted peculiar selective pressures on chickens that
caused the fat and slow ones to proliferate, just as pollinating bees select ɻowers,
causing the bright colourful ones to proliferate.
Today, the 4-billion-year-old regime of natural selection is facing a completely
diʃerent challenge. In laboratories throughout the world, scientists are
engineering living beings. They break the laws of natural selection with impunity,
unbridled even by an organisms original characteristics. Eduardo Kac, a Brazilian
bio-artist, decided in 2000 to create a new work of art: a ɻuorescent green rabbit.
Ka c contacted a French laboratory and oʃered it a fee to engineer a radiant
bunny according to his speciɹcations. The French scientists took a run-of-the-mill
white rabbit embryo, implanted in its DNA a gene taken from a green ɻuorescent
jellyɹsh, and voilà! One green ɻuorescent rabbit for le monsieur. Kac named the
rabbit Alba.
It is impossible to explain the existence of Alba through the laws of natural
selection. She is the product of intelligent design. She is also a harbinger of things
to come. If the potential Alba signiɹes is realised in full – and if humankind
doesn’t annihilate itself meanwhile – the Scientiɹc Revolution might prove itself
far greater than a mere historical revolution. It may turn out to be the most
important biological revolution since the appearance of life on earth. After 4
billion years of natural selection, Alba stands at the dawn of a new cosmic era, in
which life will be ruled by intelligent design. If this happens, the whole of human
history up to that point might, with hindsight, be reinterpreted as a process of
experimentation and apprenticeship that revolutionised the game of life. Such a
process should be understood from a cosmic perspective of billions of years, rather
than from a human perspective of millennia.
Biologists the world over are locked in battle with the intelligent-design

movement, which opposes the teaching of Darwinian evolution in schools and
claims that biological complexity proves there must be a creator who thought out
all biological details in advance. The biologists are right about the past, but the
proponents of intelligent design might, ironically, be right about the future.
At the time of writing, the replacement of natural selection by intelligent design
could happen in any of three ways: through biological engineering, cyborg
engineering (cyborgs are beings that combine organic with non-organic parts) or
the engineering of inorganic life.

Of Mice and Men

Biological engineering is deliberate human intervention on the biological level
(e.g. implanting a gene) aimed at modifying an organisms shape, capabilities,
needs or desires, in order to realize some preconceived cultural idea, such as the
artistic predilections of Eduardo Kac.
There is nothing new about biological engineering, per se. People have been
using it for millennia in order to reshape themselves and other organisms. A
simple example is castration. Humans have been castrating bulls for perhaps
10,000 years in order to create oxen. Oxen are less aggressive, and are thus easier
to train to pull ploughs. Humans also castrated their own young males to create
soprano singers with enchanting voices and eunuchs who could safely be entrusted
with overseeing the sultans harem.
But recent advances in our understanding of how organisms work, down to the
cellular and nuclear levels, have opened up previously unimaginable possibilities.
For instance, we can today not merely castrate a man, but also change his sex
through surgical and hormonal treatments. But that’s not all. Consider the
surprise, disgust and consternation that ensued when, in 1996, the following
photograph appeared in newspapers and on television:

46. A mouse on whose back scientists grew an ‘ear’ made of cattle cartilage cells. It is an eerie echo of
the lion-man statue from the Stadel Cave. Thirty thousand years ago, humans were already fantasising
about combining different species. Today, they can actually produce such chimeras.

No, Photoshop was not involved. It’s an untouched photo of a real mouse on
whose back scientists implanted cattle cartilage cells. The scientists were able to
control the growth of the new tissue, shaping it in this case into something that
looks like a human ear. The process may soon enable scientists to manufacture
artificial ears, which could then be implanted in humans.1
Even more remarkable wonders can be performed with genetic engineering,
which is why it raises a host of ethical, political and ideological issues. And it’s not
just pious monotheists who object that man should not usurp God’s role. Many
conɹrmed atheists are no less shocked by the idea that scientists are stepping into
nature’s shoes. Animal-rights activists decry the suʃering caused to lab animals in
genetic engineering experiments, and to the farmyard animals that are engineered
in complete disregard of their needs and desires. Human-rights activists are afraid
that genetic engineering might be used to create supermen who will make serfs of
the rest of us. Jeremiahs oʃer apocalyptic visions of bio-dictatorships that will
clone fearless soldiers and obedient workers. The prevailing feeling is that too
many opportunities are opening too quickly and that our ability to modify genes
is outpacing our capacity for making wise and far-sighted use of the skill.
The result is that we’re at present using only a fraction of the potential of
genetic engineering. Most of the organisms now being engineered are those with
the weakest political lobbies – plants, fungi, bacteria and insects. For example,
lines of E. coli, a bacterium that lives symbiotically in the human gut (and which
makes headlines when it gets out of the gut and causes deadly infections), have

been genetically engineered to produce biofuel.2 E. coli and several species of
fungi have also been engineered to produce insulin, thereby lowering the cost of
diabetes treatment.3 A gene extracted from an Arctic ɹsh has been inserted into
potatoes, making the plants more frost-resistant.4
A few mammals have also been subject to genetic engineering. Every year the
dairy industry suʃers billions of dollars in damages due to mastitis, a disease that
strikes dairy-cow udders. Scientists are currently experimenting with genetically
engineered cows whose milk contains lysostaphin, a biochemical that attacks the
bacteria responsible for the disease.5 The pork industry, which has suʃered from
falling sales because consumers are wary of the unhealthy fats in ham and bacon,
has hopes for a still-experimental line of pigs implanted with genetic material
from a worm. The new genes cause the pigs to turn bad omega 6 fatty acid into its
healthy cousin, omega 3.6
The next generation of genetic engineering will make pigs with good fat look
like child’s play. Geneticists have managed not merely to extend sixfold the
average life expectancy of worms, but also to engineer genius mice that display
much-improved memory and learning skills.7 Voles are small, stout rodents
resembling mice, and most varieties of voles are promiscuous. But there is one
species in which boy and girl voles form lasting and monogamous relationships.
Geneticists claim to have isolated the genes responsible for vole monogamy. If the
addition of a gene can turn a vole Don Juan into a loyal and loving husband, are
we far oʃ from being able to genetically engineer not only the individual abilities
of rodents (and humans), but also their social structures?8

The Return of the Neanderthals

But geneticists do not only want to transform living lineages. They aim to revive
extinct creatures as well. And not just dinosaurs, as in Jurassic Park. A team of
Russian, Japanese and Korean scientists has recently mapped the genome of
ancient mammoths, found frozen in the Siberian ice. They now plan to take a
fertilised egg-cell of a present-day elephant, replace the elephantine DNA with a
reconstructed mammoth DNA, and implant the egg in the womb of an elephant.
After about twenty-two months, they expect the ɹrst mammoth in 5,000 years to
be born.9
But why stop at mammoths? Professor George Church of Harvard University
recently suggested that, with the completion of the Neanderthal Genome Project,
we can now implant reconstructed Neanderthal DNA into a Sapiens ovum, thus
producing the ɹrst Neanderthal child in 30,000 years. Church claimed that he

could do the job for a paltry $30 million. Several women have already volunteered
to serve as surrogate mothers.10
What do we need Neanderthals for? Some argue that if we could study live
Neanderthals, we could answer some of the most nagging questions about the
origins and uniqueness of Homo sapiens. By comparing a Neanderthal to a Homo
sapiens brain, and mapping out where their structures diʃer, perhaps we could
identify what biological change produced consciousness as we experience it.
There’s an ethical reason, too – some have argued that if Homo sapiens was
responsible for the extinction of the Neanderthals, it has a moral duty to resurrect
them. And having some Neanderthals around might be useful. Lots of industrialists
would be glad to pay one Neanderthal to do the menial work of two Sapiens.
But why stop even at Neanderthals? Why not go back to God’s drawing board
and design a better Sapiens? The abilities, needs and desires of Homo sapiens have
a genetic basis, and the Sapiens genome is no more complex than that of voles
and mice. (The mouse genome contains about 2.5 billion nucleobases, the Sapiens
genome about 2.9 billion bases – meaning the latter is only 14 per cent larger.)11
In the medium range – perhaps in a few decades – genetic engineering and other
forms of biological engineering might enable us to make far-reaching alterations
not only to our physiology, immune system and life expectancy, but also to our
intellectual and emotional capacities. If genetic engineering can create genius
mice, why not genius humans? If it can create monogamous voles, why not
humans hard-wired to remain faithful to their partners?
The Cognitive Revolution that turned Homo sapiens from an insigniɹcant ape
into the master of the world did not require any noticeable change in physiology
or even in the size and external shape of the Sapiens brain. It apparently involved
no more than a few small changes to internal brain structure. Perhaps another
small change would be enough to ignite a Second Cognitive Revolution, create a
completely new type of consciousness, and transform Homo sapiens into something
altogether different.
True, we still don’t have the acumen to achieve this, but there seems to be no
insurmountable technical barrier preventing us from producing superhumans. The
main obstacles are the ethical and political objections that have slowed down
research on humans. And no matter how convincing the ethical arguments may
be, it is hard to see how they can hold back the next step for long, especially if
what is at stake is the possibility of prolonging human life indeɹnitely,
conquering incurable diseases, and upgrading our cognitive and emotional
abilities.
What would happen, for example, if we developed a cure for Alzheimer’s
disease that, as a side benefit, could dramatically improve the memories of healthy
people? Would anyone be able to halt the relevant research? And when the cure is

developed, could any law enforcement agency limit it to Alzheimer’s patients and
prevent healthy people from using it to acquire super-memories?
It’s unclear whether bioengineering could really resurrect the Neanderthals, but
it would very likely bring down the curtain on Homo sapiens. Tinkering with our
genes won’t necessarily kill us. But we might ɹddle with Homo sapiens to such an
extent that we would no longer be Homo sapiens.

Bionic Life

There is another new technology which could change the laws of life: cyborg
engineering. Cyborgs are beings which combine organic and inorganic parts, such
as a human with bionic hands. In a sense, nearly all of us are bionic these days,
since our natural senses and functions are supplemented by devices such as
eyeglasses, pacemakers, orthotics, and even computers and mobile phones (which
relieve our brains of some of their data storage and processing burdens). We stand
poised on the brink of becoming true cyborgs, of having inorganic features that
are inseparable from our bodies, features that modify our abilities, desires,
personalities and identities.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a US military
research agency, is developing cyborgs out of insects. The idea is to implant
electronic chips, detectors and processors in the body of a ɻy or cockroach, which
will enable either a human or an automatic operator to control the insect’s
movements remotely and to absorb and transmit information. Such a ɻy could be
sitting on the wall at enemy headquarters, eavesdrop on the most secret
conversations, and if it isn’t caught ɹrst by a spider, could inform us exactly what
the enemy is planning.12 In 2006 the US Naval Undersea Warfare Center reported
its intention to develop cyborg sharks, declaring, ‘NUWC is developing a ɹsh tag
whose goal is behaviour control of host animals via neural implants.’ The
developers hope to identify underwater electromagnetic ɹelds made by
submarines and mines, by exploiting the natural magnetic detecting capabilities of
sharks, which are superior to those of any man-made detectors.13
Sapiens, too, are being turned into cyborgs. The newest generation of hearing
aids are sometimes referred to as ‘bionic ears’. The device consists of an implant
that absorbs sound through a microphone located in the outer part of the ear. The
implant ɹlters the sounds, identiɹes human voices, and translates them into
electric signals that are sent directly to the central auditory nerve and from there
to the brain.14
Retina Implant, a government-sponsored German company, is developing a

retinal prosthesis that may allow blind people to gain partial vision. It involves
implanting a small microchip inside the patient’s eye. Photocells absorb light
falling on the eye and transform it into electrical energy, which stimulates the
intact nerve cells in the retina. The nervous impulses from these cells stimulate the
brain, where they are translated into sight. At present the technology allows
patients to orientate themselves in space, identify letters, and even recognise
faces.15
Jesse Sullivan, an American electrician, lost both arms up to the shoulder in a
2001 accident. Today he uses two bionic arms, courtesy of the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago. The special feature of Jesse’s new arms is that they are
operated by thought alone. Neural signals arriving from Jesse’s brain are
translated by micro-computers into electrical commands, and the arms move.
When Jesse wants to raise his arm, he does what any normal person unconsciously
does – and the arm rises. These arms can perform a much more limited range of
movements than organic arms, but they enable Jesse to carry out simple daily
functions. A similar bionic arm has recently been outɹtted for Claudia Mitchell, an
American soldier who lost her arm in a motorcycle accident. Scientists believe that
we will soon have bionic arms that will not only move when willed to move, but
will also be able to transmit signals back to the brain, thereby enabling amputees
to regain even the sensation of touch!16

47. Jesse Sullivan and Claudia Mitchell holding hands. The amazing thing about their bionic arms is that

they are operated by thought.

At present these bionic arms are a poor replacement for our organic originals,
but they have the potential for unlimited development. Bionic arms, for example,

can be made far more powerful than their organic kin, making even a boxing
champion feel like a weakling. Moreover, bionic arms have the advantage that
they can be replaced every few years, or detached from the body and operated at
a distance.
Scientists at Duke University in North Carolina have recently demonstrated this
with rhesus monkeys whose brains have been implanted with electrodes. The
electrodes gather signals from the brain and transmit them to external devices.
The monkeys have been trained to control detached bionic arms and legs through
thought alone. One monkey, named Aurora, learned to thought-control a detached
bionic arm while simultaneously moving her two organic arms. Like some Hindu
goddess, Aurora now has three arms, and her arms can be located in diʃerent
rooms – or even cities. She can sit in her North Carolina lab, scratch her back with
one hand, scratch her head with a second hand, and simultaneously steal a
banana in New York (although the ability to eat a purloined fruit at a distance
remains a dream). Another rhesus monkey, Idoya, won world fame in 2008 when
she thought-controlled a pair of bionic legs in Kyoto, Japan, from her North
Carolina chair. The legs were twenty times Idoya’s weight.17
Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a person loses all or nearly all her
ability to move any part of her body, while her cognitive abilities remain intact.
Patients suʃering from the syndrome have up till now been able to communicate
with the outside world only through small eye movements. However, a few
patients have had brain-signal-gathering electrodes implanted in their brains.
Eʃorts are being made to translate such signals not merely into movements but
also into words. If the experiments succeed, locked-in patients could ɹnally speak
directly with the outside world, and we might eventually be able to use the
technology to read other peoples minds.18
Yet of all the projects currently under development, the most revolutionary is
the attempt to devise a direct two-way brain-computer interface that will allow
computers to read the electrical signals of a human brain, simultaneously
transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn. What if such interfaces are
used to directly link a brain to the Internet, or to directly link several brains to
each other, thereby creating a sort of Inter-brain-net? What might happen to
human memory, human consciousness and human identity if the brain has direct
access to a collective memory bank? In such a situation, one cyborg could, for
example, retrieve the memories of another – not hear about them, not read about
them in an autobiography, not imagine them, but directly remember them as if
they were his own. Or her own. What happens to concepts such as the self and
gender identity when minds become collective? How could you know thyself or
follow your dream if the dream is not in your mind but in some collective
reservoir of aspirations?

Such a cyborg would no longer be human, or even organic. It would be
something completely diʃerent. It would be so fundamentally another kind of
being that we cannot even grasp the philosophical, psychological or political
implications.

Another Life

The third way to change the laws of life is to engineer completely inorganic
beings. The most obvious examples are computer programs and computer viruses
that can undergo independent evolution.
The ɹeld of genetic programming is today one of the most interesting spots in
the computer science world. It tries to emulate the methods of genetic evolution.
Many programmers dream of creating a program that could learn and evolve
completely independently of its creator. In this case, the programmer would be a
primum mobile, a ɹrst mover, but his creation would be free to evolve in directions
neither its maker nor any other human could ever have envisaged.
A prototype for such a program already exists – it’s called a computer virus. As
it spreads through the Internet, the virus replicates itself millions upon millions of
times, all the while being chased by predatory antivirus programs and competing
with other viruses for a place in cyberspace. One day when the virus replicates
itself a mistake occurs – a computerised mutation. Perhaps the mutation occurs
because the human engineer programmed the virus to make occasional random
replication mistakes. Perhaps the mutation was due to a random error. If, by
chance, the modiɹed virus is better at evading antivirus programs without losing
its ability to invade other computers, it will spread through cyberspace. If so, the
mutants will survive and reproduce. As time goes by, cyberspace would be full of
new viruses that nobody engineered, and that undergo non-organic evolution.
Are these living creatures? It depends on what you mean by ‘living creatures’.
They have certainly been produced by a new evolutionary process, completely
independent of the laws and limitations of organic evolution.
Imagine another possibility – suppose you could back up your brain to a
portable hard drive and then run it on your laptop. Would your laptop be able to
think and feel just like a Sapiens? If so, would it be you or someone else? What if
computer programmers could create an entirely new but digital mind, composed
of computer code, complete with a sense of self, consciousness and memory? If
you ran the program on your computer, would it be a person? If you deleted it
could you be charged with murder?
We might soon have the answer to such questions. The Human Brain Project,

founded in 2005, hopes to recreate a complete human brain inside a computer,
with electronic circuits in the computer emulating neural networks in the brain.
The projects director has claimed that, if funded properly, within a decade or two
we could have an artiɹcial human brain inside a computer that could talk and
behave very much as a human does. If successful, that would mean that after 4
billion years of milling around inside the small world of organic compounds, life
will suddenly break out into the vastness of the inorganic realm, ready to take up
shapes beyond our wildest dreams. Not all scholars agree that the mind works in a
manner analogous to today’s digital computers – and if it doesn’t, present-day
computers would not be able to simulate it. Yet it would be foolish to categorically
dismiss the possibility before giving it a try. In 2013 the project received a grant
of €1 billion from the European Union.19

The Singularity

Presently, only a tiny fraction of these new opportunities have been realised. Yet
the world of 2014 is already a world in which culture is releasing itself from the
shackles of biology. Our ability to engineer not merely the world around us, but
above all the world inside our bodies and minds, is developing at breakneck
speed. More and more spheres of activity are being shaken out of their
complacent ways. Lawyers need to rethink issues of privacy and identity;
governments are faced with rethinking matters of health care and equality; sports
associations and educational institutions need to redeɹne fair play and
achievement; pension funds and labour markets should readjust to a world in
which sixty might be the new thirty. They must all deal with the conundrums of
bioengineering, cyborgs and inorganic life.
Mapping the ɹrst human genome required ɹfteen years and $3 billion. Today
you can map a person’s DNA within a few weeks and at the cost of a few hundred
dollars.20 The era of personalized medicine – medicine that matches treatment to
DNA – has begun. The family doctor could soon tell you with greater certainty that
you face high risks of liver cancer, whereas you needn’t worry too much about
heart attacks. She could determine that a popular medication that helps 92 per
cent of people is useless to you, and you should instead take another pill, fatal to
many people but just right for you. The road to near-perfect medicine stands
before us.
However, with improvements in medical knowledge will come new ethical
conundrums. Ethicists and legal experts are already wrestling with the thorny
issue of privacy as it relates to DNA. Would insurance companies be entitled to ask

for our DNA scans and to raise premiums if they discover a genetic tendency to
reckless behaviour? Would we be required to fax our DNA, rather than our CV, to
potential employers? Could an employer favour a candidate because his DNA
looks better? Or could we sue in such cases for ‘genetic discrimination’? Could a
company that develops a new creature or a new organ register a patent on its
DNA sequences? It is obvious that one can own a particular chicken, but can one
own an entire species?
Such dilemmas are dwarfed by the ethical, social and political implications of
the Gilgamesh Project and of our potential new abilities to create superhumans.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, government medical programmes
throughout the world, national health insurance programmes and national
constitutions worldwide recognise that a humane society ought to give all its
members fair medical treatment and keep them in relatively good health. That
was all well and good as long as medicine was chieɻy concerned with preventing
illness and healing the sick. What might happen once medicine becomes
preoccupied with enhancing human abilities? Would all humans be entitled to
such enhanced abilities, or would there be a new superhuman elite?
Our late modern world prides itself on recognising, for the ɹrst time in history,
the basic equality of all humans, yet it might be poised to create the most unequal
of all societies. Throughout history, the upper classes always claimed to be
smarter, stronger and generally better than the underclass. They were usually
deluding themselves. A baby born to a poor peasant family was likely to be as
intelligent as the crown prince. With the help of new medical capabilities, the
pretensions of the upper classes might soon become an objective reality.
This is not science ɹction. Most science-ɹction plots describe a world in which
Sapiens – identical to us – enjoy superior technology such as light-speed
spaceships and laser guns. The ethical and political dilemmas central to these
plots are taken from our own world, and they merely recreate our emotional and
social tensions against a futuristic backdrop. Yet the real potential of future
technologies is to change Homo sapiens itself, including our emotions and desires,
and not merely our vehicles and weapons. What is a spaceship compared to an
eternally young cyborg who does not breed and has no sexuality, who can share
thoughts directly with other beings, whose abilities to focus and remember are a
thousand times greater than our own, and who is never angry or sad, but has
emotions and desires that we cannot begin to imagine?
Science ɹction rarely describes such a future, because an accurate description is

by deɹnition incomprehensible. Producing a ɹlm about the life of some super-
cyborg is akin to producing Hamlet for an audience of Neanderthals. Indeed, the

future masters of the world will probably be more diʃerent from us than we are
from Neanderthals. Whereas we and the Neanderthals are at least human, our

inheritors will be godlike.
Physicists deɹne the Big Bang as a singularity. It is a point at which all the
known laws of nature did not exist. Time too did not exist. It is thus meaningless
to say that anything existed ‘before’ the Big Bang. We may be fast approaching a
new singularity, when all the concepts that give meaning to our world – me, you,
men, women, love and hate – will become irrelevant. Anything happening beyond
that point is meaningless to us.

The Frankenstein Prophecy

In 1818 Mary Shelley published Frankenstein, the story of a scientist who creates
an artiɹcial being that goes out of control and wreaks havoc. In the last two
centuries, the same story has been told over and over again in countless versions.
It has become a central pillar of our new scientiɹc mythology. At ɹrst sight, the
Frankenstein story appears to warn us that if we try to play God and engineer life
we will be punished severely. Yet the story has a deeper meaning.
The Frankenstein myth confronts Homo sapiens with the fact that the last days
are fast approaching. Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, so
goes the story, the pace of technological development will soon lead to the
replacement of Homo sapiens by completely diʃerent beings who possess not only
diʃerent physiques, but also very diʃerent cognitive and emotional worlds. This is
something most Sapiens ɹnd extremely disconcerting. We like to believe that in
the future people just like us will travel from planet to planet in fast spaceships.
We don’t like to contemplate the possibility that in the future, beings with
emotions and identities like ours will no longer exist, and our place will be taken
by alien life forms whose abilities dwarf our own.
We somehow ɹnd comfort in the idea that Dr Frankenstein created a terrible
monster, whom we had to destroy in order to save ourselves. We like to tell the
story that way because it implies that we are the best of all beings, that there
never was and never will be something better than us. Any attempt to improve us
will inevitably fail, because even if our bodies might be improved, you cannot
touch the human spirit.
We would have a hard time swallowing the fact that scientists could engineer
spirits as well as bodies, and that future Dr Frankensteins could therefore create
something truly superior to us, something that will look at us as condescendingly
as we look at the Neanderthals.

We cannot be certain whether today’s Frankensteins will indeed fulɹl this

prophecy. The future is unknown, and it would be surprising if the forecasts of the
last few pages were realised in full. History teaches us that what seems to be just
around the corner may never materialise due to unforeseen barriers, and that
other unimagined scenarios will in fact come to pass. When the nuclear age
erupted in the 1940S, many forecasts were made about the future nuclear world of
the year 2000. When sputnik and Apollo 11 ɹred the imagination of the world,
everyone began predicting that by the end of the century, people would be living
in space colonies on Mars and Pluto. Few of these forecasts came true. On the
other hand, nobody foresaw the Internet.
So don’t go out just yet to buy liability insurance to indemnify you against
lawsuits ɹled by digital beings. The above fantasies – or nightmares – are just
stimulants for your imagination. What we should take seriously is the idea that the
next stage of history will include not only technological and organisational
transformations, but also fundamental transformations in human consciousness
and identity. And these could be transformations so fundamental that they will
call the very term ‘human’ into question. How long do we have? No one really
knows. As already mentioned, some say that by 2050 a few humans will already
be a-mortal. Less radical forecasts speak of the next century, or the next
millennium. Yet from the perspective of 70,000 years of Sapiens history, what are
a few millennia?
If the curtain is indeed about to drop on Sapiens history, we members of one of
its final generations should devote some time to answering one last question: what
do we want to become? This question, sometimes known as the Human
Enhancement question, dwarfs the debates that currently preoccupy politicians,
philosophers, scholars and ordinary people. After all, today’s debate between
today’s religions, ideologies, nations and classes will in all likelihood disappear
along with Homo sapiens. If our successors indeed function on a diʃerent level of
consciousness (or perhaps possess something beyond consciousness that we cannot
even conceive), it seems doubtful that Christianity or Islam will be of interest to
them, that their social organisation could be Communist or capitalist, or that their
genders could be male or female.
And yet the great debates of history are important because at least the ɹrst
generation of these gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of their human
designers. Would they be created in the image of capitalism, of Islam, or of
feminism? The answer to this question might send them careening in entirely
different directions.
Most people prefer not to think about it. Even the ɹeld of bioethics prefers to
address another question, ‘What is it forbidden to do?’ Is it acceptable to carry out
genetic experiments on living human beings? On aborted fetuses? On stem cells?
Is it ethical to clone sheep? And chimpanzees? And what about humans? All of

these are important questions, but it is naïve to imagine that we might simply hit
the brakes and stop the scientiɹc projects that are upgrading Homo sapiens into a
diʃerent kind of being. For these projects are inextricably meshed together with
the Gilgamesh Project. Ask scientists why they study the genome, or try to connect
a brain to a computer, or try to create a mind inside a computer. Nine out of ten
times you’ll get the same standard answer: we are doing it to cure diseases and
save human lives. Even though the implications of creating a mind inside a
computer are far more dramatic than curing psychiatric illnesses, this is the
standard justiɹcation given, because nobody can argue with it. This is why the
Gilgamesh Project is the ɻagship of science. It serves to justify everything science
does. Dr Frankenstein piggybacks on the shoulders of Gilgamesh. Since it is
impossible to stop Gilgamesh, it is also impossible to stop Dr Frankenstein.
The only thing we can try to do is to inɻuence the direction scientists are
taking. Since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, perhaps the real
question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’, but ‘What do we want to
want?’ Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven’t given it
enough thought.

Afterword:

The Animal that Became a God

SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO, HOMO sapiens was still an insigniɹcant
animal minding its own business in a corner of Africa. In the following millennia
it transformed itself into the master of the entire planet and the terror of the
ecosystem. Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god, poised to acquire not
only eternal youth, but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction.
Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we
can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production,
built cities, established empires and created far-ɻung trade networks. But did we
decrease the amount of suʃering in the world? Time and again, massive increases
in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens,
and usually caused immense misery to other animals.
In the last few decades we have at last made some real progress as far as the
human condition is concerned, with the reduction of famine, plague and war. Yet
the situation of other animals is deteriorating more rapidly than ever before, and
the improvement in the lot of humanity is too recent and fragile to be certain of.
Moreover, despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we
remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have
advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles – but nobody
knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very
little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more
irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us
company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on
our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our
own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction.
Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisɹed and irresponsible gods who
don’t know what they want?
